<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF GEORGE IV. (1820-1830)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">Here you see the coat which we now wear, slightly
altered, in our evening dress. It came into fashion,
with this form of top-boots, in 1799, and was called
a Jean-de-Bry. Notice the commencement of the
whisker fashion.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>v]</a></span></p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The world, if we choose to see it so, is a complicated
picture of people dressing and undressing.
The history of the world is composed of the chat
of a little band of tailors seated cross-legged on
their boards; they gossip across the centuries,
feeling, as they should, very busy and important.
Someone made the coat of many colours for Joseph,
another cut into material for Elijah&rsquo;s mantle.</p>

<p>Baldwin, from his stall on the site of the great
battle, has only to stretch his neck round to nod
to the tailor who made the toga for Julius C&aelig;sar;
has only to lean forward to smile to Pasquino, the
wittiest of tailors.</p>

<p>John Pepys, the tailor, gossips with his neighbour
who cut that jackanapes coat with silver
buttons so proudly worn by Samuel Pepys, his
son. Mr. Schweitzer, who cut Beau Brummell&rsquo;s
coat, talks to Mr. Meyer, who shaped his pantaloons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>vi]</a></span>
Our world is full of the sound of scissors,
the clipping of which, with the gossiping tongues,
drown the grander voices of history.</p>

<p>As you will see, I have devoted myself entirely
to civil costume&mdash;that is, the clothes a man or a
woman would wear from choice, and not by reason
of an appointment to some ecclesiastical post, or
to a military calling, or to the Bar, or the Bench.
Such clothes are but symbols of their trades and
professions, and have been dealt with by persons
who specialize in those professions.</p>

<p>I have taken the date of the Conquest as my
starting-point, and from that date&mdash;a very simple
period of clothes&mdash;I have followed the changes of
the garments reign by reign, fold by fold, button
by button, until we arrive quite smoothly at Beau
Brummell, the inventor of modern clothes, the
prophet of cleanliness.</p>

<p>I have taken considerable pains to trace the
influence of one garment upon its successor, to
reduce the wardrobe for each reign down to its
simplest cuts and folds, so that the reader may
follow quite easily the passage of the coat from its
birth to its ripe age, and by this means may not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>vii]</a></span>
only know the clothes of one time, but the reasons
for those garments. To the best of my knowledge,
such a thing has never been done before; most
works on dress try to include the world from
Adam to Charles Dickens, lump a century into a
page, and dismiss the ancient Egyptians in a couple
of colour plates.</p>

<p>So many young gentlemen have blown away
their patrimony on feathers and tobacco that it is
necessary for us to confine ourselves to certain
gentlemen and ladies in our own country. A
knowledge of history is essential to the study of
mankind, and a knowledge of history is never
perfect without a knowledge of the clothes with
which to dress it.</p>

<p>A man, in a sense, belongs to his clothes; they
are so much a part of him that, to take him
seriously, one must know how he walked about, in
what habit, with what air.</p>

<p>I am compelled to speak strongly of my own
work because I believe in it, and I feel that the
series of paintings in these volumes are really a
valuable addition to English history. To be modest
is often to be excessively vain, and, having made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>viii]</a></span>
an exhaustive study of my subject from my own
point of view, I do not feel called upon to hide my
knowledge under a bushel. Of course, I do not
suggest that the ordinary cultured man should
acquire the same amount of knowledge as a painter,
or a writer of historical subjects, or an actor, but he
should understand the clothes of his own people,
and be able to visualize any date in which he may
be interested.</p>

<p>One half of the people who talk glibly of Beau
Brummell have but half an idea when he lived,
and no idea that, for example, he wore whiskers.
Hamlet they can conjure up, but would have some
difficulty in recognising Shakespeare, because most
portraits of him are but head and shoulders.
Napoleon has stamped himself on men&rsquo;s minds
very largely through the medium of a certain form
of hat, a lock of hair, and a gray coat. In future
years an orchid will be remembered as an emblem.</p>

<p>I have arranged, as far as it is possible, that each
plate shall show the emblem or distinguishing
mark of the reign it illustrates, so that the continuity
of costume shall be remembered by the
arresting notes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>ix]</a></span>
As the fig-leaf identifies Adam, so may the chaperon
twisted into a cockscomb mark Richard II.
As the curled and scented hair of Alcibiades occurs
to our mind, so shall Beau Nash manage his clouded
cane. Elizabeth shall be helped to the memory
by her Piccadilly ruff; square Henry VIII. by his
broad-toed shoes and his little flat cap; Anne
Boleyn by her black satin nightdress; James be
called up as padded trucks; Maximilian as puffs
and slashes; D&rsquo;Orsay by the curve of his hat;
Tennyson as a dingy brigand; Gladstone as a
collar; and even more recent examples, as the
Whistlerian lock and the Burns blue suit.</p>

<p>And what romantic incidents may we not hang
upon our clothes-line! The cloak of Samuel Pepys
(&lsquo;Dapper Dick,&rsquo; as he signed himself to a certain
lady) sheltering four ladies from the rain; Sir Walter
Raleigh spreading his cloak over the mud to protect
the shoes of that great humorist Elizabeth (I never
think of her apart from the saying, &lsquo;Ginger for
pluck&rsquo;); Mary, Queen of Scots, ordering false
attires of hair during her captivity&mdash;all these
scenes clinched into reality by the knowledge of
the dress proper to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>x]</a></span>
And what are we doing to help modern history&mdash;the
picture of our own times&mdash;that it may look
beautiful in the ages to come? I cannot answer
you that.</p>

<p>Some chapters of this work have appeared in the
<i>Connoisseur</i>, and I have to thank the editor for his
courtesy in allowing me to reproduce them.</p>

<p>I must also thank Mr. Pownall for his help in
the early stages of my labours.</p>

<p>One thing more I must add: I do not wish this
book to go forth and be received with that frigid
politeness which usually welcomes a history to the
shelves of the bookcase, there to remain unread.
The book is intended to be read, and is not wrapped
up in grandiose phrases and a great wind about
nothing; I would wish to be thought more friendly
than the antiquarian and more truthful than the
historian, and so have endeavoured to show, in
addition to the body of the clothes, some little of
their soul.</p>

<h3>THE MEN</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 184px;">

</div>

<p>Why France should
always give the lead
in the matter of dress
is a nice point in sartorial
morality&mdash;a
morality which holds
that it takes nine tailors to
make a man and but one
milliner to break him, a code,
in fact, with which this book
will often have to deal.</p>

<p>Sartorially, then, we commence
with the 14th of October, 1066, upon
which day, fatal to the fashions of the country,
the flag of King Harold, sumptuously woven and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
embroidered in gold, bearing the figure of a
man fighting, studded with precious stones, was
captured.</p>

<p>William, of Norse blood and pirate traditions,
landed in England, and brought with him bloodshed,
devastation, new laws, new customs, and new
fashions.</p>

<p>Principal among these last was the method of
shaving the hair at the back of the head, which
fashion speedily died out by reason of the parlous
times and the haste of war, besides the utter
absurdity of the idea. Fashion, however, has no
sense of the ridiculous, and soon replaced the one
folly by some other extravagance.</p>

<p>William I. found the Saxons very plainly dressed,
and he did little to alter the masculine mode.</p>

<p>He found the Saxon ladies to be as excellent
at embroidery as were their Norman sisters, and
in such times the spindle side was content to sit
patiently at home weaving while the men were
abroad ravaging the country.</p>

<p>William was not of the stuff of dandies. No
man could draw his bow; he helped with his own
hands to clear the snowdrift on the march to
Chester. Stark and fierce he was, loving the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
solitudes of the woods and the sight of hart and
hind.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 473px;">

<img src="images/ecpl02.jpg" width="473" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF WILLIAM I. (1066-1087)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">Cloak buckled at the shoulder. Leather thongs
crossed on his legs. Shoes of leather. Tunic fitting
to his body like a jersey.</p>

<p>When some kind of order was restored in England,
many of the Saxons who had fled the country and
gone to Constantinople came back, bringing with
them the Oriental idea of dress. The Jews came
with Eastern merchandise into England, and brought
rich-coloured stuffs, and as these spread through
the country by slow degrees, there came a gradual
change in colour and material, and finer stuffs
replaced the old homespun garments.</p>

<p>The Jews were at this time very eminent as silk
manufacturers and makers of purple cloth. The
Britons had been very famous for their dyed woollen
stuffs. Boadicea is said to have worn a tunic of
chequered stuff, which was in all probability
rather of the nature of Scotch plaids.</p>

<p>The tunics worn by the men of this time were,
roughly speaking, of two kinds: those that fitted
close to the body, and those that hung loose, being
gathered into the waist by a band. The close-fitting
tunic was in the form of a knitted jersey,
with skirts reaching to the knee; it was open on
either side to the hips, and fell from the hips in
loose folds. The neck was slit open four or five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
inches, and had an edging of embroidery, and the
sleeves were wide, and reached just below the
elbows. These also had an
edging of embroidery, or a
band different in colour to
the rest of the tunic.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 140px;">
<img src="images/ecill003.png" width="140" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of William I." />
</div>

<p>The other form of tunic
was made exactly in shape
like the modern shirt, except
that the neck opening was
smaller. It was loose and
easy, with wide sleeves to the
elbow, and was gathered in
at the waist by a band of stuff
or leather.</p>

<p>The skirts of the tunics were cut square or
V-shaped in front and behind. There were also
tunics similar in shape to either of those mentioned,
except that the skirts were very short, and were
tucked into wide, short breeches which reached to
the knee, or into the trousers which men wore.</p>

<p>Under this tunic was a plain shirt, loosely fitting,
the sleeves tight and wrinkled over the wrist, the
neck showing above the opening of the tunic.
This shirt was generally white, and the opening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
at the neck was sometimes stitched with coloured
or black wool.</p>

<p>Upon the legs they wore neat-fitting drawers of
wool or cloth, dyed or of natural colour, or loose
trousers of the same materials, sometimes worn
loose, but more generally bound
round just above the knee and at
the ankle.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 98px;">
<img src="images/ecill004.png" width="98" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of William I." />
</div>

<p>They wore woollen socks, and for
footgear they wore shoes of skin
and leather, and boots of soft
leather shaped naturally to the
foot and strapped or buckled across
the instep. The tops of the boots
were sometimes ornamented with
coloured bands.</p>

<p>The cloak worn was semicircular
in shape, with or without a small semicircle cut
out at the neck. It was fastened over the right
shoulder or in the centre by means of a large
round or square brooch, or it was held in place
by means of a metal ring or a stuff loop through
which the cloak was pushed; or it was tied by
two cords sewn on to the right side of the cloak,
which cords took a bunch of the stuff into a knot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
and so held it, the ends of the cords having tags
of metal or plain ornaments.</p>

<p>One may see the very same make and fashion of
tunic as the Normans wore under their armour
being worn to-day by the Dervishes in Lower Egypt&mdash;a
coarse wool tunic, well padded, made in the
form of tunic and short drawers
in one piece, the wide sleeves
reaching just below the elbow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 128px;">
<img src="images/ecill005.png" width="128" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of William I." />
</div>

<p>The hats and caps of these
men were of the most simple
form&mdash;plain round-topped skull-caps,
flat caps close to the head
without a brim, and a hat with
a peak like the helmet.</p>

<p>Hoods, of course, were worn
during the winter, made very
close to the head, and they were
also worn under the helmets.</p>

<p>Thus in such a guise may we picture the Norman
lord at home, eating his meat with his fingers, his
feet in loose skin shoes tied with thongs, his legs in
loose trousers bound with crossed garters, his tunic
open at the neck showing the white edge of his shirt,
his face clean-shaven, and his hair neatly cropped.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 130px;">

</div>

<p>Nothing could be plainer or
more homely than the dress of
a Norman lady. Her loose
gown was made with ample
skirts reaching well on to the
ground, and it was gathered in
at the waist by a belt of wool,
cloth, silk, or cloth of gold web.</p>

<p>The gown fitted easily across
the shoulders, but fell from
there in loose folds. The neck
opening was cut as the man&rsquo;s, about five inches
down the front, and the border ornamented with
some fine needlework, as also were the borders
of the wide sleeves, which came just below the
elbows.</p>

<p>Often the gown was made short, so that when
it was girded up the border of it fell only to the
knees, and showed the long chemise below.</p>

<p>The girdle was, perhaps, the richest portion of
their attire, and was sometimes of silk diapered with
gold thread, but such a girdle would be very costly.
More often it would be plain wool, and be tied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
simply round the waist with short ends, which did
not show.</p>

<p>The chemise was a plain white garment, with
tight sleeves which wrinkled at the wrists; that is
to say, they were really too long for the arm, and
so were caught in small folds at the wrist.</p>

<p>The gown, opening at the neck in the same way
as did the men&rsquo;s tunics, showed the white of the
chemise, the opening being
held together sometimes by a
brooch.</p>

</div>

<p>Towards the end of the
reign the upper part of the
gown&mdash;that is, from the neck
to the waist&mdash;was worn close
and fitted more closely to the
figure, but not over-tightly&mdash;much
as a tight jersey would fit.</p>

<p>Over all was a cloak of the
semicircular shape, very voluminous&mdash;about three
feet in diameter&mdash;which was brooched in the centre
or on the shoulder.</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">A twist of wool holds the gown at the waist. Under
the gown the chemise shows. The neck of the gown
is embroidered.</p>

<p>On the head, where the hair was closely coiled
with a few curls at the forehead, a wimple was
worn, which was wound about the head and thrown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
over the shoulder, not allowing the hair to show.
These wimples were sometimes very broad, and
were almost like a mantle, so that they fell over
the shoulders below the breast.</p>

<p>Tied round the wimple they sometimes had a
snood, or band of silk.</p>

<p>The shoes were like those worn by the men.</p>

<p>These ladies were all housewives, cooking, preparing
simples, doing embroidery and weaving.
They were their own milliners and dressmakers,
and generally made their husbands&rsquo; clothes, although
some garments might be made by the town tailors;
but, as a rule, they weaved, cut, sewed, and fitted
for their families, and then, after the garments were
finished to satisfaction, they would begin upon
strips of embroidery to decorate them.</p>

<p>In such occupation we may picture them, and
imagine them sitting by the windows with their
ladies, busily sewing, looking up from their work
to see hedged fields in lambing-time, while shepherds
in rough sheepskin clothes drove the sheep into a
neat enclosure, and saw to it that they lay on warm
straw against the cold February night.</p>

<h2>WILLIAM THE SECOND</h2>

<h3>THE MEN</h3>

<p>About this time there
came to England a
Norman, who settled
near by the Abbey of
Battle&mdash;Baldwin the
Tailor by name, whom
one might call the father of
English tailoring.</p>

<p>Baldwin the Tailor sat
contentedly cross-legged on
his bench and plied his
needle and thread, and snipped,
and cut, and sewed, watching the birds
pick worms and insects from the turf of the battleground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
England is getting a little more settled.</p>

<p>The reign opens picturesquely enough with
William Rufus hastening to England with his
father&rsquo;s ring, and ends with the tragedy of the
New Forest and a blood-stained tunic.</p>

<p>Clothes begin to play an important part. Rich
fur-lined cloaks and gowns trail on the ground,
and sweep the daisies so lately pressed by mailed
feet and sopped with
blood where the Saxons
fell.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 176px;">
<img src="images/ecill009.png" width="176" height="250" alt="" />
<span class="caption">The Cloak pushed through a Ring.</span>
</div>

<p>Times have changed
since Baldwin was at
the coronation at Westminster
on Christmas
Day twenty years ago.
Flemish weavers and
farmers arrive from
overseas, and are established
by William II.
in the North to teach
the people pacific arts,
causing in time a stream of Flemish merchandise
to flow into the country, chiefly of rich fabrics and
fine cloths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
The men adopt longer tunics, made after the
same pattern as before&mdash;split up either side and
loose in the sleeve&mdash;but in many cases the skirts
reach to the ground in heavy folds, and the sleeves
hang over the hands by quite a yard.</p>

<p>The necks of these tunics are ornamented as
before, with coloured bands or stiff embroidery.</p>

<p>The cuffs have the embroidery both inside and
out, so that when the long sleeve is turned back
over the hand the embroidery will show.</p>

<p>The fashion in cloaks is still the same&mdash;of a
semicircular pattern.</p>

<p>The shoes are the same as in the previous reign&mdash;that
is, of the shape of the foot, except in rare
cases of dandyism, when the shoes were made with
long, narrow toes, and these, being stuffed with
moss or wool, were so stiffened and curled up at
the ends that they presented what was supposed
to be a delightfully extravagant appearance.</p>

<p>They wore a sort of ankle garter of soft leather
or cloth, which came over the top of the boot and
just above the ankle.</p>

<p>The hair, beard, and moustaches were worn long
and carefully combed&mdash;in fact, the length of the
beard caused the priests to rail at them under such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
terms as &lsquo;filthy goats.&rsquo; But they had hardly the
right to censorship, since they themselves had to
be severely reprimanded by their Bishops for their
extravagance in dress.</p>

<p>Many gentlemen, and especially the Welsh, wore
long loose trousers as far as the ankle, leaving these
garments free from
any cross gartering.
These were secured
about the waist by a
girdle of stuff or
leather.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 197px;">
<img src="images/ecill010.png" width="197" height="250"
alt="Two men of the time of William II." />
</div>

<p>The ultra-fashionable
dress was an
elongation of every
part of the simple
dress of the previous
reign. Given these
few details, it is easy
for anyone who wishes to go further to do so,
in which case he must keep to the main outline
very carefully; but as to the actual length
of sleeve or shoe, or the very measurements of
a cloak, they varied with the individual folly of
the owner. So a man might have long sleeves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
and a short tunic, or a tunic which trailed upon
the ground, the sleeves of which reached only to
the elbow.</p>

<p>I have noticed that it is the general custom of
writers upon the dress of this early time to dwell
lovingly upon the colours of the various parts of
the dress as they were painted in the illuminated
manuscripts. This is a foolish waste of time, insomuch
as the colours were made the means of
displays of pure design on the part of the very
early illuminators; and if one were to go upon such
evidence as this, by the exactness of such drawings
alone, then every Norman had a face the colour of
which nearly resembled wet biscuit, and hair picked
out in brown lines round each wave and curl.</p>

<p>These woollen clothes&mdash;cap, tunic, semicircular
cloak, and leg coverings&mdash;have all been actually
found in the tomb of a Briton of the Bronze Age.
So little did the clothes alter in shape, that the
early Briton and the late Norman were dressed
nearly exactly alike.</p>

<p>When the tomb of William II. was opened in
1868, it was found, as had been suspected, that the
grave had been opened and looted of what valuables
it might have contained; but there were found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
among the dust which filled the bottom of the
tomb fragments of red cloth, of gold cloth, a
turquoise, a serpent&rsquo;s head in ivory, and a wooden
spear shaft, perhaps the very spear that William
carried on that fatal day in the New Forest.</p>

<p>Also with the dust and bones of the dead King
some nutshells were discovered, and examination
showed that mice had been able to get into the
tomb. So, if you please, you may hit upon a pretty
moral.</p>


<h3>THE WOMEN</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 84px;">
<img src="images/ecill011.png" width="84" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of William II." />
</div>

<p>And so the lady began to lace....</p>

<p>A moralist, a denouncer of the fair
sex, a satirist, would have his fling at
this. What thundering epithets and
avalanche of words should burst out
at such a momentous point in English
history!</p>

<p>However, the lady pleased herself.</p>

<p>Not that the lacing was very tight,
but it commenced the habit, and the
habit begat the harm, and the thing
grew until it arrived finally at that
buckram, square-built, cardboard-and-tissue figure
which titters and totters through the Elizabethan era.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
Our male eyes, trained from infancy upwards to
avoid gazing into certain shop windows, nevertheless
retain a vivid impression of an awesome affair
therein, which we understood by hints and signs
confined our mothers&rsquo; figures in its deadly grip.</p>

<p>That the lady did not lace herself overtight is
proved by the many informations we have of her
household duties; that she laced tight enough for
unkind comment is shown by the fact that some
old monk pictured the devil in a neat-laced gown.</p>

<p>It was, at any rate, a distinct departure from the
loosely-clothed lady of 1066 towards the neater
figure of 1135.</p>

<p>The lacing was more to draw the wrinkles of the
close-woven bodice of the gown smooth than to
form a false waist and accentuated hips, the beauty
of which malformation I must leave to the writers
in ladies&rsquo; journals and the condemnation to health
faddists.</p>

<p>However, the lacing was not the only matter of
note. A change was coming over all feminine
apparel&mdash;a change towards richness, which made
itself felt in this reign more in the fabric than in the
actual make of the garment.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 480px;">
<a name="pl05" id="pl05"></a>
<img src="images/ecpl05.jpg" width="480" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF WILLIAM II. (1087-1100)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">This shows the gown, which is laced behind, fitting
more closely to the figure. The sleeves are wider
above the wrist.</p>

<p>The gown was open at the neck in the usual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
manner, was full in the skirt and longer than
heretofore, was laced at the back, and was loose
in the sleeve.</p>

<p>The sleeve as worn by the men&mdash;that is, the over-long
sleeve hanging down over the hand&mdash;was also
worn by the women, and hung down
or was turned back, according to the
freak of the wearer. Not only this,
but a new idea began, which was to
cut a hole in the long sleeve where
the hand came, and, pushing the
hand through, to let the rest of the
sleeve droop down. This developed,
as we shall see later.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/ecill012.png" width="100" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of William II." />
</div>

<p>Then the cloak, which had before
been fastened by a brooch on the
shoulder or in the centre of the
breast, was now held more tightly over the shoulders
by a set of laces or bands which ran round the back
from underneath the brooch where they were
fastened, thus giving more definition to the
shoulders.</p>

<p>You must remember that such fashions as the
hole in the sleeve and the laced cloak were not any
more universal than is any modern fashion, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
the good dame in the country was about a century
behind the times with her loose gown and heavy
cloak.</p>

<p>There were still the short gowns, which, being
tucked in at the waist by the girdle, showed the
thick wool chemise below and the
unlaced gown, fitting like a jersey.</p>

<p>The large wimple was still worn
wrapped about the head, and the hair
was still carefully hidden.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 78px;">
<img src="images/ecill013.png" width="78" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of William II." />
</div>

<p>Shall we imagine that it is night, and
that the lady is going to bed? She is
in her long white chemise, standing at
the window looking down upon the
market square of a small town.</p>

<p>The moon picks out every detail of
carving on the church, and throws the
porch into a dense gloom. Not a soul is about,
not a light is to be seen, not a sound is to be
heard.</p>

<p>The lady is about to leave the window, when she
hears a sound in the street below. She peers down,
and sees a man running towards the church; he
goes in and out of the shadows. From her open
window she can hear his heavy breathing. Now he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
darts into the shadow of the porch, and then out
of the gloom comes a furious knocking, and a voice
crying, &lsquo;Sanctuary!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The lady at her window knows that cry well.
Soon the monks in the belfry will awake and ring
the Galilee-bell.</p>

<p>The Galilee-bell tolls, and the knocking ceases.</p>

<p>A few curious citizens look out. A dog barks.
Then a door opens and closes with a bang.</p>

<p>There is silence in the square again, but the
lady still stands at her window, and she follows
the man in her thoughts.</p>

<p>Now he is admitted by the monks, and goes at
once to the altar of the patron-saint of the church,
where he kneels and asks for a coroner.</p>

<p>The coroner, an aged monk, comes to him and
confesses him. He tells his crime, and renounces
his rights in the kingdom; and then, in that dark
church, he strips to his shirt and offers his clothes
to the sacrist for his fee. Ragged, mud-stained
clothes, torn cloak, all fall from him in a heap upon
the floor of the church.</p>

<p>Now the sacrist gives him a large cloak with a
cross upon the shoulder, and, having fed him, gives
him into the charge of the under-sheriff, who will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
next day pass him from constable to constable
towards the coast, where he will be seen on board
a ship, and so pass away, an exile for ever.</p>

<p>The night is cold. The lady pulls a curtain
across the window, and then, stripping herself of
her chemise, she gets into bed.</p>

<h2>HENRY THE FIRST</h2>

<p class="smlfont center">Reigned thirty-five years: 1100-1135.</p>

<p class="smlfont center">Born 1068. Married to Matilda of Scotland, 1100; to
Adela of Louvain, 1121.</p>


<h3>THE MEN</h3>

</div>

<p>The Father of Popular Literature,
Gerald of Wales, says:
&lsquo;It is better to be dumb than
not to be understood. New
times require new fashions, and
so I have thrown utterly aside
the old and dry methods of
some authors, and aimed at
adopting the fashion of speech
which is actually in vogue
to-day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Vainly, perhaps, I have endeavoured
to follow this precept
laid down by Father Gerald, trying by slight
pictures of the times to make the dry bones live,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
to make the clothes stir up and puff themselves
into the shapes of men.</p>

<p>It is almost a necessity that one who would
describe, paint, stage, or understand the costume
of this reign should know the state of England at
the time.</p>

<p>For there is in this reign a distinction without
a difference in clothes; the shapes are almost
identical to the shapes and patterns of the previous
reigns, but everybody is a little better dressed.</p>

<p>The mantles worn by the few in the time of
William the Red are worn now by most of the
nobility, fur-lined and very full.</p>

<p>One may see on the sides of the west door of
Rochester Cathedral Henry and his first wife, and
notice that the mantle he wears is very full; one
may see that he wears a supertunic, which is gathered
round his waist. This tunic is the usual Norman
tunic reaching to the knee, but now it is worn over
an under-tunic which reaches to the ground in heavy
folds.</p>

<p>One may notice that the King&rsquo;s hair is long and
elegantly twisted into pipes or ringlets, and that it
hangs over his shoulders.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 488px;">
<a name="pl06" id="pl06"></a>
<img src="images/ecpl06.jpg" width="488" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY I. (1100-1135)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">His hair is curled in ringlets; he wears a long cloak.
The shirt shows at the neck of the tunic. The small
design in the corner is from a sanctuary door-knocker.</p>

<p>No longer is the priestly abuse of &lsquo;filthy goat&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
applicable, for Henry&rsquo;s beard is neatly trimmed
and cut round his face.</p>

<p>These two things are the only practical difference
between the two dates&mdash;the end of the eleventh
century and the beginning of the twelfth.</p>

<p>The under-tunic was made as a perfectly plain
gown with tight sleeves ending at the wrist; it
hung loose and full upon the figure. Over this
was worn the short tunic with wide sleeves ending
at the elbow. Both tunics would have broad borders
of embroidered work or bands of coloured material.
The supertunic would be brooched by one of those
circular Norman brooches which was an ornamental
circle of open gold-work in which stones and jewels
were set. The brooch was fastened by a central
pin.</p>

<p>The extravagances of the previous reign were in
some measure done away with; even the very long
hair was not fashionable in the latter half of this
reign, and the ultra-long sleeve was not so usual.</p>

<p>So we may give as a list of clothes for men in
this reign:</p>

<p>A white linen shirt.</p>

<p>A long tunic, open at the neck, falling to the
ground, with tight sleeves to the wrist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
A short tunic reaching only to the knees, more
open at the neck than the long tunic, generally
fastened by a brooch.</p>

<p>Tight, well-fitting drawers or loose trousers.</p>

<p>Bandages or garters crossed from the ankle to
the knee to confine the loose trousers or ornament
the tights.</p>

<p>Boots of soft leather which had an ornamental
band at the top.</p>

<p>Socks with an embroidered top.</p>

<p>Shoes of cloth and leather with an embroidered
band down the centre and round the top.</p>

<p>Shoes of skin tied with leather thongs.</p>

<p>Caps of skin or cloth of a very plain shape and
without a brim.</p>

<p>Belts of leather or cloth or silk.</p>

<p>Semicircular cloaks fastened as previously described,
and often lined with fur.</p>

<p>The clothes of every colour, but with little or
no pattern; the patterns principally confined to
irregular groups of dots.</p>

<p>And to think that in the year in which Henry
died Nizami visited the grave of Omar Al Khayy&aacute;m
in the Hira Cemetery at Nishapur!</p>

<p class="caption">A CHILD OF THE TIME OF HENRY I.</p>

<p class="subcapt">It is only in quite recent years that there have been
quite distinct dresses for children, fashions indeed
which began with the ideas for the improvement in
hygiene. For many centuries children were dressed,
with slight modifications, after the manner of their
parents, looking like little men and women, until in
the end they arrived at the grotesque infants of
Hogarth&rsquo;s day, powdered and patched, with little
stiff skirted suits and stiff brocade gowns, with little
swords and little fans and, no doubt, many pretty
airs and graces.</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">One thing I have never seen until the early sixteenth
century, and that is girls wearing any of
the massive head-gear of their parents; in all other
particulars they were the same.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE WOMEN</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/ecill015.png" width="125" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of Henry I." />
</div>

<p>The greatest change in the
appearance of the women was
in the arrangement of the hair.</p>

<p>After a hundred years or
more of headcloths and hidden
hair suddenly appears a head
of hair. Until now a lady
might have been bald for all
the notice she took of her
hair; now she must needs
borrow hair to add to her
own, so that her plaits shall
be thick and long.</p>

<p>It is easy to see how this came about. The hair,
for convenience, had always been plaited in two
plaits and coiled round the head, where it lay concealed
by the wimple. One day some fine lady
decides to discard her close and uncomfortable
head-covering. She lets her plaits hang over her
shoulders, and so appears in public. Contempt of
other ladies who have fine heads of hair for the
thinness of her plaits; competition in thick and
long hair; anger of ladies whose hair is not thick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
and long; enormous demand for artificial hair;
failure of the supply to meet the ever-increasing
demand; invention of silken cases filled with a
substitute for hair, these cases attached to the end
of the plaits to elongate them&mdash;in this manner do
many fashions arrive and flourish, until such time
as the common people find means of copying them,
and then my lady wonders how she could ever have
worn such a common affair.</p>

<p>The gowns of these ladies remained much the
same, except that the loose gown, without any
show of the figure, was in great favour; this gown
was confined by a long girdle.</p>

<p>The girdle was a long rope of silk or wool, which
was placed simply round the waist and loosely
knotted; or it was wound round above the waist
once, crossed behind, and then knotted in front, and
the ends allowed to hang down. The ends of the
girdle had tassels and knots depending from them.</p>

<p>The silk cases into which the hair was placed
were often made of silk of variegated colours, and
these cases had metal ends or tassels.</p>

<p>The girdles sometimes were broad bands of silk
diapered with gold thread, of which manufacture
specimens remain to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
The sleeves of the gowns had now altered in
shape, and had acquired a sort of pendulent cuff,
which hung down about two hands&rsquo; breadth from
the wrist. The border was, as usual, richly ornamented.</p>

</div>

<p>Then we have a new invention, the pelisse. It is
a loose silk coat, which is brooched at the waist, or
buttoned into a silk loop.
The sleeves are long&mdash;that
is, they gradually increase
in size from the underarm
to the wrist, and sometimes
are knotted at the ends,
and so are unlike the other
gown sleeves, which grow
suddenly long near to the
wrist.</p>

<p>This pelisse reaches to
the knees, and is well open in front. The idea was
evidently brought back from the East after the
knights arrived back from the First Crusade, as it
is in shape exactly like the coats worn by Persian
ladies.</p>

<p>We may conceive a nice picture of Countess
Constance, the wife of Hugh Lufus, Earl of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
Chester, as she appeared in her dairy fresh from
milking the cows, which were her pride. No doubt
she did help to milk them; and in her long under-gown,
with her plaits once more confined in the
folds of her wimple, she made cheeses&mdash;such good
cheeses that Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury,
rejoiced in a present of some of them.</p>

<p>What a change it must have been to Matilda,
free of the veil that she hated, from the Black
Nuns of Romsey, and the taunts and blows of her
aunt Christina, to become the wife of King Henry,
and to disport herself in fine garments and long
plaited hair&mdash;Matilda the very royal, the daughter
of a King, the sister to three Kings, the wife of a
King, the mother of an Empress!</p>

<h3>THE MEN</h3>

<p>When one regards the
mass of material in existence
showing costume of
the tenth and eleventh centuries,
it appears curious
that so little fabric remains
of this particular period.</p>

<p>The few pieces of fabric
in existence are so worn
and bare that they tell little,
whereas pieces of earlier
date of English or Norman
material are perfect,
although thin and delicate.</p>

<p>There are few illuminated manuscripts of the
twelfth century, or of the first half of it, and to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
few there are all previous historians of costume
have gone, so that one is left without choice but to
go also to these same books. The possibilities,
however, of the manuscripts referred to have not
been exhausted, and too much attention has been
paid to the queer drawing of the illuminators; so
that where they utilized to the full the artistic
license, others have sought to pin it down as
accurate delineation of the costume of the time.
In this I have left out all the supereccentric
costumes, fearing that such existed merely in the
imagination of the artist, and I have applied myself
to the more ordinary and understandable.
As there are such excellent works on armour, I
have not touched at all upon the subject, so that we
are left but the few simple garments that men wore
when they put off their armour, or that the peasant
and the merchant habitually wore.</p>

<p>Ladies occupied their leisure in embroidery and
other fine sewing, in consequence of which the
borders of tunics, of cloaks, the edgings of sleeves,
and bands upon the shoes, were elegantly patterned.
The more important the man, the finer his shoes.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 478px;">

<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF STEPHEN (1135-1154)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">He is wearing a cloak with hood attached; it is of
skin, the smooth leather inside. He has an ankle
gaiter covering the top of his shoes. On the arm
over which the cloak hangs can be seen the white
sleeve of the shirt.</p>

<p>As will be seen from the drawings, the man
wore his hair long, smoothly parted in the centre,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
with a lock drawn down the parting from the back
of his head. As a rule, the hair curled back naturally,
and hung on the shoulders, but sometimes the
older fashion of the past reign remained, and the
hair was carefully curled
in locks and tied with
coloured ribbon.</p>

<p>Besides the hood as
covering for the head,
men wore one or other
of the simple caps
shown, made of cloth or
of fur, or of cloth fur-lined.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/ecill018.png" width="165" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Stephen; two types of shoe; a boot" />
</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 455px;">
<img src="images/ecill019.png" width="455" height="300"
alt="Two types of tunic; two types of cloak; four types of sleeve showing cuff variations" />
</div>

<p>Next to his skin the
man of every class wore
a shirt of the pattern
shown&mdash;the selfsame
shirt that we wear to day, excepting that the
sleeves were made very long and tight-fitting, and
were pushed back over the wrist, giving those
wrinkles which we notice on all the Bayeux
tapestry sleeves, and which we see for many
centuries in drawings of the undergarment. The
shape has always remained the same; the modes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
of fastening the shirt differ very slightly&mdash;so
little, in fact, that a shirt of the fourth century
which still remains in existence shows the same
button and loop that we notice of the shirts of
the twelfth century. The richer man had his
shirt embroidered round the neck and sometimes
at the cuffs. Over this garment the man wore
his tunic&mdash;of wool, or cloth, or (rarely) of silk;
the drawing explains the exact making of it. The
tunic, as will be seen, was embroidered at the
neck, the cuffs, and round the border. One drawing
shows the most usual of these tunics, while the
other drawings will explain the variations from it&mdash;either
a tight sleeve made long and rolled back, a
sleeve made very wide at the cuff and allowed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
hang, or a sleeve made so that it fell some way
over the hand. It was embroidered inside and out
at the cuff, and was turned back to allow free use
of the hand.</p>

<p>Over the tunic was worn the cloak, a very simple
garment, being a piece of cloth cut in the shape
of a semicircle, embroidered on the border or
not, according to the purse and position of the
owner. Sometimes a piece was cut out to fit
the neck.</p>

<p>Another form of cloak was worn with a hood.
This was generally used for travelling, or worn by
such people as shepherds. It was made for the
richer folk of fine cloth, fur-lined, or entirely of fur,
and for the poorer people of skin or wool.</p>

<p>The cloak was fastened by a brooch, and was
pinned in the centre or on either shoulder, most
generally on the right; or it was pushed through a
ring sewn on to the right side of the neck of the
cloak.</p>

<p>The brooches were practically the same as those
worn in the earlier reigns, or were occasionally of a
pure Roman design.</p>

<p>As will be seen in the small diagrams of men
wearing the clothes of the day, the tunic, the shirt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
and the cloak were worn according to the season,
and many drawings in the MSS. of the date show
men wearing the shirt alone.</p>

<p>On their legs men wore trousers of leather for
riding, bound round with leather thongs, and
trousers of wool also,
bound with coloured
straps of wool or cloth.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 157px;">
<img src="images/ecill020.png" width="157" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Stephen; an alternative hat for a man" />
</div>

<p>Stockings of wool were
worn, and cloth stockings
also, and socks. There
was a sock without a
foot, jewelled or embroidered
round the top,
which was worn over
the stocking and over
the top of the boot in
the manner of ankle
gaiters.</p>

<p>The country man wore twists of straw round his
calf and ankle.</p>

<p>For the feet there were several varieties of boots
and shoes made of leather and stout cloth, now and
again with wooden soles. As has been said before,
the important people rejoiced in elegant footgear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
of all colours. All the shoes buttoned with one
button above the outside ankle. The boots were
sometimes tall, reaching to the bottom of the calf
of the leg, and were rolled over, showing a coloured
lining. Sometimes they were loose and wrinkled
over the ankle. They were both, boot and shoe,
made to fit the foot; for in this reign nearly all the
extravagances of the previous reign had died out,
and it is rare to find drawings or mention of long
shoes stuffed with tow or wool.</p>

<p>During the reign of Stephen the nation was
too occupied in wars and battles to indulge in
excessive finery, and few arts flourished, although
useful improvements occurred in the crafts.</p>

<p>There is in the British Museum a fine enamelled
plate of this date which is a representation of
Henry of Blois, Stephen&rsquo;s brother, who was the
Bishop of Winchester. Part of the inscription,
translated by Mr. Franks, says that &lsquo;Art is above
gold and gems,&rsquo; and that &lsquo;Henry, while living,
gives gifts of brass to God.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Champlev&eacute; enamel was very finely made in the
twelfth century, and many beautiful examples remain,
notably a plaque which was placed on the
column at the foot of which Geoffrey Plantagenet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
was buried. It is a portrait of him, and shows
the Byzantine influence still over the French
style.</p>

<p>This may appear to be rather apart from costume,
but it leads one to suppose that the ornaments of
the time may have been frequently executed in
enamel or in brass&mdash;such ornaments as rings and
brooches.</p>

<p>It is hard to say anything definite about the
colours of the dresses at this time. All that we
can say is that the poorer classes were clothed principally
in self-coloured garments, and that the dyes
used for the clothes of the nobles were of very
brilliant hues. But a street scene would be more
occupied by the colour of armour. One would
have seen a knight and men-at-arms&mdash;the knight
in his plain armour and the men in leather and
steel; a few merchants in coloured cloaks, and
the common crowd in brownish-yellow clothes
with occasional bands of colour encircling their
waists.</p>

<p>The more simply the people are represented, the
more truthful will be the picture or presentation.
Few pictures of this exact time are painted, and
few stories are written about it, but this will give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
all the information necessary to produce any picture
or stage-play, or to illustrate any story.</p>

<p>The garments are perfectly easy to cut out and
make. In order to prove this I have had them
made from the bare outlines given here, without
any trouble.</p>


<h3>THE WOMEN</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 126px;">

alt="A woman of the time of Stephen" />
</div>

<p>Though many parts of England
were at this time being
harassed by wars, still the
domestic element grew and
flourished.</p>

<p>The homes of the English
from being bare and rude began
to know the delights of embroidery
and weaving. The
workroom of the ladies was
the most civilized part of the
castle, and the effect of the
Norman invasion of foreign fashions was beginning
to be felt.</p>

<p>As the knights were away to their fighting, so
were the knights&rsquo; ladies engaged in sewing sleeve
embroideries, placing of pearls upon shoes, making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
silk cases for their hair, and otherwise stitching,
cutting, and contriving against the return of their
lords.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 127px;">
<img src="images/ecill022.png" width="127" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of Stephen" />
</div>

<p>It is recorded that Matilda escaped from Oxford
by a postern in a white dress, and no doubt her
women sympathizers made much
of white for dresses.</p>

<p>The ladies wore a simple
undergarment of thin material
called a sherte or camise; this
was bordered with some slight
embroidery, and had tightish
long sleeves pushed back over
the wrist. The garment fell
well on to the ground. This
camise was worn by all classes.</p>

<p>The upper garment was one
of three kinds: made from the neck to below the
breast, including the sleeves of soft material; from
the breast to the hips it was made of some elastic
material, as knitted wool or thin cloth, stiffened by
criss-cross bands of cloth, and was fitted to the
figure and laced up the back; the lower part was
made of the same material as the sleeves and bust.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 443px;">
<a name="pl10" id="pl10"></a>
<img src="images/ecpl10.jpg" width="443" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF STEPHEN (1135-1154)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">Her dress fits to her figure by lacing at the back.
Her long sleeves are tied up to keep them from
trailing upon the ground. Her hair is fastened at
the end into silken cases. She has a wimple in her
hands which she may wind about her head.</p>

<p>The second was made tight-fitting in the body
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
and bust, all of one elastic material, and the skirt
of loose thin stuff.</p>

<p>The third was a loose tunic reaching half-way
between the knees and feet, showing the camise,
and tied about the waist and hips by a long girdle.</p>

<p>The sleeves of these garments showed as many
variations as those of the men, but with the poor
folk they were short and useful, and with the rich
they went to extreme length, and were often knotted
to prevent them from trailing on the ground.</p>

<p>The collar and the borders of the sleeves were
enriched with embroidery in simple designs.</p>

<p>In the case of the loose upper garment the border
was also embroidered.</p>

<p>In winter a cloak of the same shape as was worn
by the men was used&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, cut exactly semicircular,
with embroidered edges.</p>

<p>The shoes of the ladies were fitted to the foot in
no extravagant shape, and were sewn with bands
of pearls or embroidery. The poorer folk went
about barefoot.</p>

<p>The hair was a matter of great moment and most
carefully treated; it was parted in the centre and
then plaited, sometimes intertwined with coloured
ribbands or twists of thin coloured material; it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
added to in length by artificial hair, and was tied
up in a number of ways. Either it was placed in
a tight silk case, like an umbrella case, which came
about half-way up the plait from the bottom, and
had little tassels depending from it, or the hair was
added to till it reached nearly to the feet, and was
bound round with ribbands, the ends having little
gold or silver pendants. The hair hung, as a rule,
down the front on either side of the face, or occasionally
behind down the back, as was the case
when the wimple was worn.</p>

<p>When the ladies went travelling or out riding
they rode astride like men, and wore the ordinary
common-hooded cloak.</p>

<p>Brooches for the tunic and rings for the fingers
were common among the wealthy.</p>

<p>The plait was introduced into the architecture of
the time, as is shown by a Norman moulding at
Durham.</p>

<p>Compared with the Saxon ladies, these ladies of
Stephen&rsquo;s time were elegantly attired; compared
with the Plantagenet ladies, they were dressed in
the simplest of costumes. No doubt there were,
as in all ages, women who gave all their body and
soul to clothes, who wore sleeves twice the length
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
of anyone else, who had more elaborate plaits and
more highly ornamented shoes; but, taking the
period as a whole, the clothes of both sexes were
plainer than in any other period of English
history.</p>

<p>One must remember that when the Normans
came into the country the gentlemen among the
Saxons had already borrowed
the fashions prevalent in
France, but that the ladies
still kept in the main to simple
clothes; indeed, it was the
man who strutted to woo clad
in all the fopperies of his time&mdash;to
win the simple woman
who toiled and span to deck
her lord in extravagant embroideries.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 143px;">
<img src="images/ecill023.png" width="143" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of Stephen" />
</div>

<p>The learning of the country
was shared by the ladies and
the clergy, and the influence of Osburgha, the
mother of Alfred, and Editha, the wife of Edward
the Confessor, was paramount among the noble
ladies of the country.</p>

<p>The energy of the clergy in this reign was more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
directed to building and the branches of architecture
than to the more studious and sedentary works of
illumination and writing, so that the sources from
which we gather information with regard to the
costume in England are few, and also peculiar, as
the drawing of this date was, although careful,
extremely archaic.</p>

<p>Picture the market-town on a market day when
the serfs were waiting to buy at the stalls until the
buyers from the abbey and the castle had had their
pick of the fish and the meat. The lady&rsquo;s steward
and the Father-Procurator bought carefully for their
establishments, talking meanwhile of the annual
catch of eels for the abbey.</p>

<p>Picture Robese, the mother of Thomas, the son
of Gilbert Becket, weighing the boy Thomas each
year on his birthday, and giving his weight in
money, clothes, and provisions to the poor. She
was a type of the devout housewife of her day, and
the wife of a wealthy trader.</p>

<p>The barons were fortifying their castles, and the
duties of their ladies were homely and domestic.
They provided the food for men-at-arms, the
followers, and for their husbands; saw that simples
were ready with bandages against wounds and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
sickness; looked, no doubt, to provisions in case of
siege; sewed with their maidens in a vestiary or
workroom, and dressed as best they could for their
position. What they must have heard and seen
was enough to turn them from the altar of fashion
to works of compassion. Their houses contained
dreadful prisons and dungeons, where men were
put upon rachentegs, and fastened to these beams
so that they were unable to sit, lie, or sleep, but
must starve. From their windows in the towers
the ladies could see men dragged, prisoners, up to
the castle walls, through the hall, up the staircase,
and cast, perhaps past their very eyes, from the
tower to the moat below. Such times and sights
were not likely to foster proud millinery or dainty
ways, despite of which innate vanity ran to ribbands
in the hair, monstrous sleeves, jewelled shoes, and
tight waists. The tiring women were not overworked
until a later period, when the hair would
take hours to dress, and the dresses months to
embroider.</p>

<p>In the town about the castle the merchants&rsquo;
wives wore simple homespun clothes of the same
form as their ladies. The serfs wore plain smocks
loose over the camise and tied about the waist, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
in the bitter cold weather skins of sheep and wolves
unlined and but roughly dressed.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 118px;">
<img src="images/ecill024.png" width="118" height="200" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Cases for the Hair.</span>
</div>

<p>In 1154 the Treaty of Wallingford brought
many of the evils to an end, and Stephen was
officially recognised as King, making Henry his
heir. Before the year was out Stephen died.</p>

<p>I have not touched on ecclesiastical costume
because there are so many excellent and complete
works upon such dress, but I may
say that it was above all civil dress
most rich and magnificent.</p>

<p>I have given this slight picture
of the time in order to show a reason
for the simplicity of the dress, and
to show how, enclosed in their walls,
the clergy were increasing in riches
and in learning; how, despite the
disorders of war, the internal peace of the towns
and hamlets was growing, with craft gilds and
merchant gilds. The lords and barons fighting
their battles knew little of the bond of strength
that was growing up in these primitive labour
unions; but the lady in her bower, in closer touch
with the people, receiving visits from foreign
merchants and pedlars with rare goods to sell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
or barter, saw how, underlying the miseries of
bloodshed and disaster, the land began to bloom
and prosper, to grow out of the rough place it
had been into the fair place of market-town and
garden it was to be.</p>

<p>Meanwhile London&rsquo;s thirteen conventual establishments
were added to by another, the Priory
of St. Bartholomew, raised by Rahere, the King&rsquo;s
minstrel.</p>

</div>

<p>The King himself is described
as being careless of dress,
chatty, outspoken. His hair
was close-cropped, his neck
was thick, and his eyes were
prominent; his cheek-bones
were high, and his lips coarse.</p>

<p>The costume of this reign
was very plain in design, but
rich in stuffs. Gilt spurs were
attached to the boots by red
leather straps, gloves were
worn with jewels in the backs of them, and the
mantles seem to have been ornamented with
designs.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY II. (1154-1189)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">He wears the short cloak, and his long tunic is held
by a brooch at the neck and is girdled by a long-tongued
belt. There are gloves on his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
The time of patterns upon clothes began. The
patterns were simple, as crescents, lozenges, stars.</p>

<p>William de Magna Villa had come back from
the Holy Land with a new fabric, a precious silk
called &lsquo;imperial,&rsquo; which was made in a workshop
patronized by the Byzantine Emperors.</p>

<p>The long tunic and the short supertunic were
still worn, but these were not so frequently split
up at the side.</p>

<p>High boots reaching to the calf of the leg were
in common use.</p>

<p>That part of the hood which fell upon the
shoulders was now cut in a neat pattern round the
edge.</p>

<p>Silks, into which gold thread was sewn or woven,
made fine clothes, and cloth cloaks lined with expensive
furs, even to the cost of a thousand pounds
of our money, were worn.</p>

<p>The loose trouser was going out altogether, and
in its stead the hose were made to fit more closely
to the leg, and were all of gay colours; they were
gartered with gold bands crossed, the ends of which
had tassels, which hung down when the garter was
crossed and tied about the knee.</p>

<p>Henry, despite his own careless appearance, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
nicknamed Court Manteau, or Short Mantle, on
account of a short cloak or mantle he is supposed
to have brought into fashion.</p>

<p>The shirts of the men, which showed at the
opening of the tunic, were buttoned with small
gold buttons or studs of gold sewn into the linen.</p>

<p>The initial difference in this reign was the more
usual occurrence of patterns in diaper upon the
clothes.</p>

<p>The length of a yard was fixed by the length of
the King&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>With the few exceptions mentioned, the costume
is the same as in the time of Stephen.</p>

<p>It is curious to note what scraps of pleasant
gossip come to us from these early times: St.
Thomas &agrave; Becket dining off a pheasant the day
before his martyrdom; the angry King calling to
his knights, &lsquo;How a fellow that hath eaten my
bread, a beggar that first came to my Court on a
lame horse, dares to insult his King and the Royal
Family, and tread upon my whole kingdom, and
not one of the cowards I nourish at my table, not
one will deliver me of this turbulent priest!&rsquo;&mdash;the
veins no doubt swelling on his bull-like neck, the
prominent eyes bloodshot with temper, the result
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
of that angry speech, to end in the King&rsquo;s public
penance before the martyr&rsquo;s tomb.</p>

<p>Picture the scene at Canterbury on August 23,
1179, when Louis VII., King of France, dressed in
the manner and habit of a pilgrim, came to the
shrine and offered there his cup of gold and a royal
precious stone, and vowed a gift of a hundred hogsheads
of wine as a yearly rental to the convent.</p>

<p>A common sight in London streets at this time
was a tin medal of St. Thomas hung about the
necks of the pilgrims.</p>

<p>And here I cannot help but give another picture.
Henry II., passing through Wales on his way to
Ireland in 1172, hears the exploits of King Arthur
which are sung to him by the Welsh bards. In
this song the bards mention the place of King
Arthur&rsquo;s burial, at Glastonbury Abbey in the
churchyard. When Henry comes back from
Ireland he visits the Abbot of Glastonbury, and
repeats to him the story of King Arthur&rsquo;s tomb.</p>

<p>One can picture the search: the King talking
eagerly to the Abbot; the monks or lay-brothers
digging in the place indicated by the words of the
song; the knights in armour, their mantles wrapped
about them, standing by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
Then, as the monks search 7 feet below the
surface, a spade rings upon stone. Picture the
interest, the excitement of these antiquarians. It is
a broad stone which is uncovered, and upon it is a
thin leaden plate in the form of a corpse, bearing
the inscription:</p>

<p class="center">&lsquo;HIC JACET SEPULTUS INCLYTUS REX ARTURIUS IN INSULA
AVALONIA.&rsquo;</p>

<p>They draw up this great stone, and with greedy
eyes read the inscription. The monks continue to
dig. Presently, at the depth of 16 feet, they find
the trunk of a tree, and in its hollowed shape lie
Arthur and his Queen&mdash;Arthur and Guinevere,
two names which to us now are part of England,
part of ourselves, as much as our patron St.
George.</p>

<p>Here they lie upon the turf, and all the party
gaze on their remains. The skull of Arthur is
covered with wounds; his bones are enormous.
The Queen&rsquo;s body is in a good state of preservation,
and her hair is neatly plaited, and is of the
colour of gold. Suddenly she falls to dust.</p>

<p>They bury them again with great care. So lay
our national hero since he died at the Battle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
Camlan in Cornwall in the year 542, and after
death was conveyed by sea to Glastonbury, and all
traces of his burial-place lost except in the songs of
the people until such day as Henry found him and
his Queen.</p>


<h3>THE WOMEN</h3>

</div>

<p>About this time came the
fashion of the chin-band, and
again the glory of the hair
was hidden under the wimple.</p>

<p>To dress a lady&rsquo;s hair for
this time the hair must be
brushed out, and then divided
into two parts: these are to
be plaited, and then brought
round the crown of the head
and fastened in front above
the forehead. The front pieces
of hair are to be neatly pushed back from the
forehead, to show a high brow. Now a cloth of
linen is taken, folded under the chin, and brought
over the top of the head, and there pinned. Then
another thin band of linen is placed round the
head and fastened neatly at the back; and over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
all a piece of fine linen is draped, and so arranged
that it shall just cover the forehead-band and fall
on to the shoulders. This last piece of linen is
fastened to the chin-band and the forehead-strap
by pins.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/ecill027.png" width="150" height="200"
alt="Four steps to dress a woman's hair" />
</div>

<p>This fashion gave rise in later times to a linen
cap; the forehead-strap was increased in height and
stiffened so that it rose slightly
above the crown of the head,
and the wimple, instead of hanging
over it, was sewn down inside
it, and fell over the top of the
cap. Later the cap was sewn
in pleats.</p>

<p>The gown of this time was
quite loose, with a deep band
round the neck and round the hem of the skirts,
which were very full. So far as one can tell, it
was put on over the head, having no other opening
but at the neck, and was held at the waist
by an ornamental girdle.</p>

<p>The chemise showed above the neck of the gown,
which was fastened by the usual round brooch.</p>

<p class="caption">A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY II. (1154-1189)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">There is a chin-band to be seen passing under the
wimple; this band is pinned to hold it round the
head.</p>

<p>The sleeves were well fitting, rather loose at the
elbow, and fell shaped over the wrist, where there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
was a deep border of embroidery. It is quite possible
that the cuffs and hem may have been made of fur.</p>

<p>The shoes were, as usual to the last two reigns,
rather blunt at the toe, and generally fitting without
buckle, button, or strap round the ankle, where
they were rolled back.</p>

<p>Above the waist the tied girdle was still worn,
but this was being supplanted by a broad belt of
silk or ornamented leather, which fastened by
means of a buckle. The tongue of the belt was
made very long, and when buckled hung down
below the knee.</p>

<p>The cloaks, from the light way in which they are
held, appear to have been made of silk or some such
fine material as fine cloth. They are held on to the
shoulders by a running band of stuff or a silk cord,
the ends of which pass through two fasteners sewn
on to the cloak, and these are knotted or have some
projecting ornament which prevents the cord from
slipping out of the fastener.</p>

<p>In this way one sees the cloak hanging from
the shoulders behind, and the cord stretched tight
across the breast, or the cord knotted in a second
place, and so bringing the cloak more over the
shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
The effigy of the Queen at Fontevraud shows
her dress covered with diagonal bars of gold, in the
triangles of which there are gold crescents placed
from point to point, and no doubt other ladies of
her time had their emblems or badges embroidered
into their gowns.</p>

<h2>RICHARD THE FIRST</h2>

<p class="smlfont center">Reigned ten years: 1189-1199.</p>

<p class="smlfont center">Born 1157. Married, 1191, to Berengaria of Navarre.</p>


<h3>THE MEN</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 145px;">
<img src="images/ecill028.png" width="145" height="250"

</div>

<p>The King had but little
influence over dress in his
time, seeing that he left
England as soon as he was
made King, and only came
back for two months in
1194 to raise money and to
be crowned again.</p>

<p>The general costume was
then as plain as it had ever
been, with long tunics and
broad belts fastened by a
big buckle.</p>

<p>The difference in costume between this short
reign and that of Henry II. is almost imperceptible;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
if any difference may be noted, it is in the
tinge of Orientalism in the garments.</p>

<p>There is more of the long and flowing robe, more
of the capacious mantle, the wider sleeve.</p>

<p>No doubt the many who came from the Crusades
made a good deal of difference to English homes,
and actual dresses and tunics from the East, of
gorgeous colours and Eastern designs, were, one
must suppose, to be seen in England.</p>

<p>Cloth of gold and cloth of gold and silks&mdash;that
is, warf of silk and weft of gold&mdash;were much prized,
and were called by various names from the Persian,
as &lsquo;ciclatoun,&rsquo; &lsquo;siglaton.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Such stuff, when of great thickness and value&mdash;so
thick that six threads of silk or hemp were in
the warf&mdash;was called &lsquo;samite.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Later, when the cloth of gold was more in use,
and the name had changed from &lsquo;ciclatoun&rsquo; to
&lsquo;bundekin,&rsquo; and from that to &lsquo;tissue,&rsquo; to keep such
fine cloth from fraying or tarnishing, they put very
thin sheets of paper away between the folds of the
garments; so to this day we call such paper tissue-paper.</p>

<p>Leaf-gold was used sometimes over silk to give
pattern and richness to it.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 475px;">

<p class="caption ipadbase">A MAN OF THE TIME OF RICHARD I. (1189-1199)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
A curious survival of this time, which has a connection
with costume, was the case of Abraham
Thornton in 1818. Abraham Thornton was accused
of having drowned Mary Ashford, but he was
acquitted by the jury. This acquittal did not
satisfy popular feeling, and the brother of Mary
Ashford appealed. Now Thornton was well advised
as to his next proceeding, and, following the still
existent law of this early time of which I write,
he went to Westminster Hall, where he threw
down, as a gage of battle, an antique gauntlet
without fingers or thumb, of white tanned skin
ornamented with silk fringes and sewn work,
crossed by a narrow band of leather, the fastenings
of leather tags and thongs.</p>

<p>This done, he declared himself ready to defend
himself in a fight, and so to uphold his innocence,
saying that he was within his rights, and that no
judge could compel him to come before a jury.</p>

<p>This was held to be good and within the law, so
Abraham Thornton won his case, as the brother
refused to pick up the gauntlet. The scandal of
this procedure caused the abolishment of the trial
by battle, which had remained in the country&rsquo;s
laws from the time of Henry II. until 1819.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
It was a time of foreign war and improvement
in military armour and arms. Richard I. favoured
the cross-bow, and brought it into general use in
England to be used in conjunction with the old
4-foot bow and the great bow 6 feet long with the
cloth-yard arrow&mdash;a bow which could send a shaft
through a 4-inch door.</p>

<p>For some time this military movement, together
with the influence of the East, kept England from
any advance or great change in costume; indeed,
the Orientalism reached a pitch in the age of
Henry III. which, so far as costume is concerned,
may be called the Age of Draperies.</p>

<p>To recall such a time in pictures, one must then
see visions of loose-tuniced men, with heavy cloaks;
of men in short tunics with sleeves tight or loose at
the wrists; of hoods with capes to them, the cape-edge
sometimes cut in a round design; of soft
leather boots and shoes, the boots reaching to the
calf of the leg. To see in the streets bright
Oriental colours and cloaks edged with broad
bands of pattern; to see hooded heads and bared
heads on which the hair was long; to see many
long-bearded men; to see old men leaning on tan-handled
sticks; the sailor in a cap or coif tied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
under his chin; the builder, stonemason, and skilled
workman in the same coif; to see, as a whole, a
brilliant shifting colour scheme in which armour
gleamed and leather tunics supplied a dull, fine
background. Among these one might see, at a
town, by the shore, a thief of a sailor being carried
through the streets with his head shaven, tarred
and feathered.</p>


<h3>THE WOMEN</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 147px;">

</div>

<p>It is difficult to describe an
influence in clothes.</p>

<p>It is difficult nowadays to
say in millinery where Paris
begins and London accepts.
The hint of Paris in a gown
suggests taste; the whole of
Paris in a gown savours of
servile imitation.</p>

<p>No well-dressed Englishwoman
should, or does, look
French, but she may have
a subtle cachet of France if she choose.</p>

<p>The perfection of art is to conceal the means to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
the end; the perfection of dress is to hide the
milliner in the millinery.</p>

<p>The ladies of Richard I.&rsquo;s time did not wear
Oriental clothes, but they had a flavour of
Orientalism pervading their dress&mdash;rather masculine
Orientalism than feminine.</p>

<p>The long cloak with the cord that held it over
the shoulders; the long, loose gown of fine colours
and simple designs; the soft, low, heelless shoes; the
long, unbound hair, or the hair held up and concealed
under an untied wimple&mdash;these gave a touch of
something foreign to the dress.</p>

<p>Away in the country there was little to dress for,
and what clothes they had were made in the house.
Stuffs brought home from Cyprus, from Palestine,
from Asia Minor, were laboriously conveyed to the
house, and there made up into gowns. Local smiths
and silver-workers made them buckles and brooches
and ornamental studs for their long belts, or clasps
for their purses.</p>

<p>A wreck would break up on the shore near by,
and the news would arrive, perhaps, that some bales
of stuff were washed ashore and were to be sold.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 433px;">

</div>

<p class="caption">A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF RICHARD I. (1189-1199)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">Her very full cloak is kept in place by the cord which
passes through loops. A large buckle holds the
neck of the gown well together. The gown is
ornamented with a simple diaper pattern; the hem
and neck are deeply embroidered.</p>

<p>The female anchorites of these days were busy
gossips, and from their hermitage or shelter by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
bridge on the road would see the world go by, and
pick up friends by means of gifts of bandages or
purses made by them, despite the fact that this
traffic was forbidden to them.</p>

<p>So the lady in the country might get news of her
lord abroad, and hear that certain silks and stuffs
were on their way home.</p>

<p>The gowns they wore were long, flowing and loose;
they were girded about the middle with leathern
or silk belts, which drew the gown loosely together.
The end of the belt, after being buckled, hung down
to about the knee. These gowns were close at the
neck, and there fastened by a brooch; the sleeves
were wide until they came to the wrist, over which
they fitted closely.</p>

<p>The cloaks were ample, and were held on by
brooches or laces across the bosom.</p>

<p>The shoes were the shape of the foot, sewn,
embroidered, elaborate.</p>

<p>The wimples were pieces of silk or white linen
held to the hair in front by pins, and allowed to
flow over the head at the back.</p>

<p>There were still remaining at this date women
who wore the tight-fitting gown laced at the back,
and who tied their chins up in gorgets.</p>

<h2>JOHN</h2>

<p class="smlfont center">Reigned seventeen years: 1199-1216.</p>

<p class="smlfont center">Born 1167. Married, in 1189, to Hadwisa, of Gloucester,
whom he divorced; married, in 1200, to Isabella
of Angoul&ecirc;me.</p>


<h3>THE MEN</h3>

<p>There was a garment in this reign
which was the keynote of costume
at the time, and this was the surcoat.
It had been worn over the armour
for some time, but in this reign it
began to be an initial part of dress.</p>

<p>Take a piece of stuff about 9 or 10
yards in length and about 22 inches
wide; cut a hole in the centre of this
wide enough to admit of a man&rsquo;s head passing
through, and you have a surcoat.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption ipadbase">A MAN OF THE TIME OF JOHN (1199-1216)</p>

<p>Under this garment the men wore a flowing
gown, the sleeves of which were so wide that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
reached at the base from the shoulder to the waist,
and narrowed off to a tight band at the wrist.</p>

<p>These two garments were held together by a
leather belt buckled about the middle, with the
tongue of the belt hanging down.</p>

<p>Broad borders of design edged the gowns at the
foot and at the neck, and heraldic devices were
sewn upon the surcoats.</p>

<p>King John himself, the quick, social, humorous
man, dressed very finely. He loved the company
of ladies and their love, but in spite of his love for
them, he starved and tortured them, starved and
beat children, was insolent, selfish, and wholly
indifferent to the truth. He laughed aloud during
the Mass, but for all that was superstitious to the
degree of hanging relics about his neck; and he was
buried in a monk&rsquo;s cowl, which was strapped under
his chin.</p>

<p>Silk was becoming more common in England,
and the cultivation of the silkworm was in some
measure gaining hold. In 1213 the Abbot of
Cirencester, Alexander of Neckham, wrote upon
the habits of the silkworm.</p>

<p>Irish cloth of red colour was largely in favour,
presumably for cloaks and hoods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
The general costume of this reign was very much
the same as that of Henry II. and Richard I.&mdash;the
long loose gown, the heavy cloak, the long hair cut
at the neck, the fashion of beards, the shoes, belts,
hoods, and heavy fur cloaks, all much the same as
before, the only real difference
being in the general use of
the surcoat and the very convenient
looseness of the sleeves
under the arms.</p>

<p>There is an inclination in
writing of a costume one can
visualize mentally to leave out
much that might be useful to
the student who knows little or
nothing of the period of dress
in which one is writing; so
perhaps it will be better to now dress a man
completely.</p>

<p>First, long hair and a neatly-trimmed beard; over
this a hood and cape or a circular cap, with a slight
projection on the top of it.</p>

<p>Second, a shirt of white, like a modern soft shirt.</p>

<p>Third, tights of cloth or wool.</p>

<p>Fourth, shoes strapped over the instep or tied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
with thongs, or fitting at the ankle
like a slipper, or boots of soft leather
turned over a little at the top, at
the base of the calf of the leg.</p>

<p>Fifth, a gown, loosely fitting,
buckled at the neck, with sleeves
wide at the top and tight at the
wrist, or quite loose and coming to
just below the elbow, or a tunic
reaching only to the knees, both
gown and tunic fastened with a belt.</p>

<p>Sixth, a surcoat sometimes, at others a cloak held
together by a brooch, or made for travelling with a
hood.</p>

<p>This completes an ordinary wardrobe of the time.</p>


<h3>THE WOMEN</h3>

<p>As may be seen from the plate, no change in
costume took place.</p>

<p>The hair plaited and bound round the head or
allowed to flow loose upon the shoulders.</p>

<p>Over the hair a gorget binding up the neck and
chin. Over all a wimple pinned to the gorget.</p>

<p>A long loose gown with brooch at the neck.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
Sleeves tight at the wrist. The whole gown held
in at the waist by a belt, with one long end hanging
down.</p>

<p>Shoes made to fit the shape of the foot, and very
elaborately embroidered and sewn.</p>

<p>A long cloak with buckle or lace fastening.</p>

<p>In this reign there were thirty English towns
which had carried on a trade in dyed cloths for
fifty years.</p>

</div>

<p>Despite the fact that historians allude
to the extravagance of this reign, there
is little in the actual form of the costume
to bear out the idea. Extravagant
it was in a large way, and costly
for one who would appear well dressed;
but the fopperies lay more in the stuffs
than in the cut of the garments worn.</p>

<p>It was an age of draperies.</p>

<p>This age must call up pictures of
bewrapped people swathed in heavy
cloaks of cloth of Flanders dyed with
the famous Flemish madder dye; of people in silk
cloaks and gowns from Italy; of people in loose
tunics made of English cloth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
This long reign of over fifty years is a transitional
period in the history of clothes, as in its course the
draped man developed very slowly towards the
coated man, and the loose-hung clothes very
gradually began to shape themselves to the body.</p>

<p>The transition from tunic and cloak and Oriental
draperies is so slow and so little marked by definite
change that to the ordinary observer the Edwardian
cotehardie seems to have sprung from nowhere:
man seems to have, on a sudden, dropped his stately
wraps and mantles and discarded his chrysalis form
to appear in tight lines following the figure&mdash;a form
infinitely more gay and alluring to the eye than the
ponderous figure that walks through the end of the
thirteenth century.</p>

<p>Up to and through the time from the Conquest
until the end of Henry III.&rsquo;s reign the clothes of
England appear&mdash;that is, they appear to me&mdash;to
be lordly, rich, fine, but never courtier-like and
elegant.</p>

<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY III. (1216-1272)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">Heavy cloak and fulness of dress characteristic of
this time.</p>

<p>If one may take fashion as a person, one may
say: Fashion arrived in 1066 in swaddling-clothes,
and so remained enveloped in rich cloaks and flowing
draperies until 1240, when the boy began to
show a more active interest in life; this interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
grew until, in 1270, it developed into a distaste for
heavy clothes; but the boy knew of no way as yet
in which to rid himself of the trailings of his mother
cloak. Then, in about 1272, he invented a cloak
more like a strange, long tunic, through which he
might thrust his arms for freedom; on this cloak
he caused his hood to be fastened, and so made
himself three garments in one, and gave himself
greater ease.</p>

<p>Then dawned the fourteenth century&mdash;the youth
of clothes&mdash;and our fashion boy shot up, dropped
his mantles and heaviness, and came out from
thence slim and youthful in a cotehardie.</p>

<p>Of such a time as this it is not easy to say the
right and helpful thing, because, given a flowing
gown and a capacious mantle, imagination does the
rest. Cut does not enter into the arena.</p>

<p>Imagine a stage picture of this time: a mass of
wonderful, brilliant colours&mdash;a crowd of men in
long, loose gowns or surcoats; a crowd of ladies
in long, loose gowns; both men and women hung
with cloaks or mantles of good stuffs and gay
colours. A background of humbler persons in
homespun tunics with cloth or frieze hoods over
their heads. Here and there a fop&mdash;out of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
date, a quarter-century before his time&mdash;in a loose
coat with pocket-holes in front and a buttoned neck
to his coat, his shoes very pointed and laced at the
sides, his hair long, curled, and bound by a fillet or
encompassed with a cap with an upturned brim.</p>

<p>The beginning of the coat was this: the surcoat,
which up till now was split at both sides from the
shoulder to the hem, was now
sewn up, leaving only a wide
armhole from the base of the
ribs to the shoulder. This surcoat
was loose and easy, and
was held in at the waist by a
belt. In due time a surcoat appeared
which was slightly shaped
to the figure, was split up in front
instead of at the sides, and in
which the armholes were smaller
and the neck tighter, and fastened
by two or three buttons. In front
of this surcoat two pocket-holes showed. This
surcoat was also fastened by a belt at the waist.</p>

<p>In common with the general feeling towards
more elaborate clothes, the shoes grew beyond
their normal shape, and now, no longer conforming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
to the shape of the foot, they became elongated at
the toes, and stuck out in a sharp point; this point
was loose and soft, waiting for a future day when
men should make it still longer and stuff it with
tow and moss.</p>

<p>Of all the shapes of nature, no shape has been so
marvellously maltreated as the human foot. It has
suffered as no other portion of the body has
suffered: it has endured exceeding length and
exceeding narrowness; it has been swelled into
broad, club-like shapes; it has been artificially
raised from the ground, ended off square, pressed
into tight points, curved under, and finally, as to-day,
placed in hard, shining, tight leather boxes.
All this has been done to one of the most beautiful
parts of the human anatomy by the votaries of
fashion, who have in turn been delighted to expose
the curves of their bodies, the round swelling of
their hips, the beauties of their nether limbs, the
whiteness of their bosoms, the turn of their elbows
and arms, and the rotundity of their shoulders, but
who have, for some mysterious reasons, been for
hundreds of years ashamed of the nakedness of
their feet.</p>

<p>Let me give a wardrobe for a man of this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
A hood with a cape to it; the peak of the hood
made full, but about half a hand&rsquo;s breadth longer
than necessary to the hood; the cape cut sometimes
at the edge into a number of short slits.</p>

<p>A cap of soft stuff to fit the head, with or without
an upturned brim. A fillet of silk or metal for
the hair.</p>

<p>A gown made very loose and open at the neck,
wide in the body, the sleeves loose or tight to the
wrist. The gown long or short, on the ground or
to the knee, and almost invariably belted at the
waist by a long belt of leather with ornamental
studs.</p>

<p>A surcoat split from shoulder to hem, or sewn
up except for a wide armhole.</p>

<p>A coat shaped very slightly to the figure, having
pocket-holes in front, small armholes, and a buttoned
neck.</p>

<p>A great oblong-shaped piece of stuff for a cloak,
or a heavy, round cloak with an attached hood.</p>

<p>Tights of cloth or sewn silk&mdash;that is, pieces of
silk cut and sewn to the shape of the leg.</p>

<p>Shoes with long points&mdash;about 2 inches beyond
the toes&mdash;fastened by a strap in front, or laced at
the sides, or made to pull on and fit at the ankle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
the last sometimes with a V-shaped piece cut away
on either side.</p>

<p>There was a tendency to beads, and a universal
custom of long hair.</p>

<p>In all such clothes as are mentioned above every
rich stuff of cloth, silk, wool, and frieze may be
used, and fur linings and fur hats are constant, as
also are furred edges to garments.</p>

<p>There was a slight increase of heraldic ornament,
and a certain amount of foreign diaper patterning
on the clothes.</p>


<h3>THE WOMEN</h3>

<p>Now the lady must needs begin to repair the
ravages of time and touch the cheek that no longer
knows the bloom of youth with&mdash;rouge.</p>

<p>This in itself shows the change in the age. Since
the Britons&mdash;poor, simple souls&mdash;had sought to
embellish Nature by staining themselves blue with
woad and yellow with ochre, no paint had touched
the faces of the fashionable until this reign. Perhaps
discreet historians had left that fact veiled, holding
the secrets of the lady&rsquo;s toilet too sacred for the
black of print; but now the murder came out.
The fact in itself is part of the psychology of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
clothes. Paint the face, and you have a hint
towards the condition of fashion.</p>

<p>Again, as in the case of the men, no determined
cut shows which will point to this age as one of
such and such a garment or such an innovation,
but&mdash;and this I would leave to your imagination&mdash;there
was a distinction that was not great enough
to be a difference.</p>

<p>The gowns were loose and flowing, and were
gathered in at the waist by a girdle, or, rather, a
belt, the tongue of which hung down in front; but
as the end of the reign approached, the gowns were
shaped a little more to the figure.</p>

<p>A lady might possess such clothes as these: the
gowns I have mentioned above, the sleeves of
which were tight all the way from the shoulder to
the wrist, or were loose and cut short just below
the elbow, showing the tight sleeves of the under-gown.</p>

<p>Shoes very elaborately embroidered and pointed
at the toes.</p>

<p>A rich cloak made oblong in shape and very
ample in cut.</p>

<p>A shaped mantle with strings to hold it together
over the shoulders.</p>

<h2>THE COUNTRY FOLK</h2>

<p class="smlfont center">From the Conquest to the reign of Edward I.</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/ecill035.png" width="120" height="250"
alt="A countryman" />
</div>

<p>Until the present day the
countryman has dressed in a
manner most fitted to his surroundings;
now the billycock hat,
a devil-derived offspring from a
Greek source, the Sunday suit of
shiny black with purple trousers,
the satin tie of Cambridge blue,
and the stiff shirt, have almost
robbed the peasant of his poetical
appearance.</p>

<p>Civilization seems to have
arrived at our villages with a pocketful of petty
religious differences, a bagful of public-houses, a
bundle of penny and halfpenny papers full of stories
to show the fascination of crime and&mdash;these Sunday
clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
The week&rsquo;s workdays still show a sense of the
picturesque in corduroys and jerseys or blue shirts,
but the landscape is blotted with men wearing out
old Sunday clothes, so that the painter of rural
scenes with rural characters must either lie or
go abroad.</p>

<p>As for the countrywoman, she, I am thankful to
say, still retains a sense of duty and beauty, and,
except on Sunday, remains more or
less respectably clad. Chivalry prevents
one from saying more.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 94px;">
<img src="images/ecill036.png" width="94" height="250"
alt="A countryman" />
</div>

<p>In the old days&mdash;from the Conquest
until the end of the thirteenth century&mdash;the
peasant was dressed in perfect clothes.</p>

<p>The villages were self-providing;
they grew by then wool and hemp
for the spindles. From this was made
yarn for materials to be made up into
coats and shirts. The homespun frieze that the
peasant wore upon his back was hung by the nobleman
upon his walls. The village bootmaker made,
besides skin sandals to be tied with thongs upon the
feet, leather trousers and belts.</p>

<p>The mole-catcher provided skin for hats. Hoods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
of a plain shape were made from the hides of sheep
or wolves, the wool or hair being left on the hood.
Cloaks lined with sheepskin served to keep away
the winter cold.</p>

<p>To protect their legs from thorns the men wore
bandages of twisted straw wrapped round their
trousers, or leather thongs cross-gartered to the
knee.</p>

<p>The fleece of the sheep was woven in the summer
into clothes of wool for the winter. Gloves were
made, at the beginning of the thirteenth century,
of wool and soft leather; these were shaped like the
modern baby&rsquo;s glove, a pouch for the hand and
fingers and a place for the thumb.</p>

<p>A coarse shirt was worn, over which a tunic, very
loosely made, was placed, and belted at the waist.
The tunic hardly varied in shape from the Conquest
to the time of Elizabeth, being but a sack-like
garment with wide sleeves reaching a little below
the elbow. The hood was ample and the cloak
wide.</p>

<p>The women wore gowns of a like material to the
men&mdash;loose gowns which reached to the ankles and
gave scope for easy movement. They wore their
hair tied up in a wimple of coarse linen.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 466px;">

<p class="caption">A PEASANT OF EARLY ENGLAND<br />
(WILLIAM I.-HENRY III.)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">His hood is made from sheepskin, the wool outside,
the hem trimmed into points. His legs are bound
up with garters of plaited straw. His shoes are of
the roughest make of coarse leather. He has the
shepherd&rsquo;s horn slung over his shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
The people of the North were more ruggedly
clothed than the Southerners, and until the monks
founded the sheep-farming industry in Yorkshire
the people of those parts had no doubt to depend
for their supply of wool upon
the more cultivated peoples.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 164px;">
<img src="images/ecill037.png" width="164" height="250"

</div>

<p>Picture these people, then,
in very simple natural wool-coloured
dresses going about
their ordinary country life,
attending their bees, their
pigs, sheep, and cattle, eating
their kele soup, made of colewort
and other herbs.</p>

<p>See them ragged and
hungry, being fed by Remigius, Bishop of Lincoln,
after all the misery caused by the Conquest; or
despairing during the Great Frost of 1205, which
began on St. Hilary&rsquo;s Day, January 11, and lasted
until March 22, and was so severe that the land
was like iron, and could not be dug or tilled.</p>

<p>When better days arrived, and farming was taken
more seriously by the great lords, when Grosseteste,
the Bishop of Lincoln, wrote his book on farming
and estate management for Margaret, the Dowager-Countess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
of Lincoln, then clothes and stuffs manufactured
in the towns became cheaper and more
easy to obtain, and the very rough skin clothes and
undressed hides began to vanish from among the
clothes of the country, and the rough gartered
trouser gave way before cloth cut to fit the leg.</p>

<p>On lord and peasant alike the sun of this early
age sets, and with the sunset comes the warning
bell&mdash;the <i>couvre-feu</i>&mdash;so, on their beds of straw-covered
floors, let them sleep....</p>

<h2>EDWARD THE FIRST</h2>

<p class="smlfont center">Reigned thirty-five years: 1272-1307.</p>

<p class="smlfont center">Born 1239. Married, 1254, Eleanor of Castile;

<h3>MEN AND WOMEN</h3>

<p>Until the performance of the Sherborne Pageant,
I had never had the opportunity of seeing a mass
of people, under proper, open-air conditions, dressed
in the peasant costume of Early England.</p>

<p>For once traditional stage notions of costume
were cast aside, and an attempt was made, which
was perfectly successful, to dress people in the
colours of their time.</p>

<p>The mass of simple colours&mdash;bright reds, blues,
and greens&mdash;was a perfect expression of the date,
giving, as nothing else could give, an appearance of
an illuminated book come to life.</p>

<p>One might imagine that such a primary-coloured
crowd would have appeared un-English, and too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
Oriental or Italian; but with the background of
trees and stone walls, the English summer sky
distressed with clouds, the moving cloud shadows
and the velvet grass, these fierce hard colours
looked distinctly English, undoubtedly of their
date, and gave the spirit of the ages, from a clothes
point of view, as no other colours could have done.
In doing this they attested to the historical truth
of the play.</p>

<p>It seemed natural to see an English crowd
one blazing jewel-work of colour, and, by the
excellent taste and knowledge of the designer,
the jewel-like hardness of colour was consistently
kept.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see the difference made to
this crowd by the advent of a number of monks
in uniform black or brown, and to see the setting
in which these jewel-like peasants shone&mdash;the
play of brilliant hues amid the more sombre
browns and blacks, the shifting of the blues
and reds, the strong notes of emerald green&mdash;all,
like the symmetrical accidents of the
kaleidoscope, settling into their places in perfect
harmony.</p>

<p>The entire scene bore the impress of the spirit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
of historical truth, and it is by such pageants that
we can imagine coloured pictures of an England
of the past.</p>

<p>Again, we could observe the effect of the light-reflecting
armour, cold, shimmering steel, coming
in a play of colour against the background of
peasants, and thereby one could note the exact
appearance of an ordinary English day of such
a date as this of which I now write, the end of the
thirteenth century.</p>

<p>The mournful procession bearing the body of
Queen Eleanor of Castile, resting at Waltham,
would show a picture in the same colours as the
early part of the Sherborne Pageant.</p>

<p>Colour in England changed very little from the
Conquest to the end of the reign of Edward I.;
the predominant steel and leather, the gay, simple
colours of the crowds, the groups of one colour,
as of monks and men-at-arms, gave an effect of
constantly changing but ever uniform colours and
designs of colour, exactly, as I said before, like the
shifting patterns of the kaleidoscope.</p>

<p>It was not until the reign of Edward II. that
the effect of colour changed and became pied, and
later, with the advent of stamped velvets, heavily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
designed brocades, and the shining of satins, we
get that general effect best recalled to us by
memories of Italian pictures; we get, as it were,
a varnish of golden-brown over the crude beauties
of the earlier times.</p>

<p>It is intensely important to a knowledge of
costume to remember the larger changes in the
aspect of crowds from the colour point of view.
A knowledge of history&mdash;by which I do not mean
a parrot-like acquirement of dates and Acts of
Parliament, but an insight into history as a living
thing&mdash;is largely transmitted to us by pictures;
and, as pictures practically begin for us with the
Tudors, we must judge of coloured England from
illuminated books. In these you will go from
white, green, red, and purple, to such colours as
I have just described: more vivid blues, reds, and
greens, varied with brown, black, and the colour of
steel, into the chequered pages of pied people and
striped dresses, into rich-coloured people, people
in black; and as you close the book and arrive at
the wall-picture, back to the rich-coloured people
again.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 341px;">
<img src="images/ecill038.png" width="341" height="250"
alt="Three men of the time of Edward I." />
</div>

<p>The men of this time, it must be remembered,
were more adapted to the arts of war than to those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
of peace; and the knight who was up betimes and
into his armour, and to bed early, was not a man
of so much leisure that he could stroll about in
gay clothes of an inconvenient make. His principal
care was to relieve himself of his steel burden and
get into a loose gown, belted at the waist, over
which, if the weather was inclement, he would
wear a loose coat. This coat was made with a
hood attached to it, very loose and easy about the
neck and very wide about the body; its length
was a matter of choice, but it was usual to wear
it not much below the knees. The sleeves were
also wide and long, having at a convenient place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
a hole cut, through which the arms could be
placed.</p>

<p>The men wore their hair long and brushed out
about the ears&mdash;long, that is, to the nape of the
neck. They also were most commonly bearded,
with or without a moustache.</p>

<p>Upon their heads they wore soft, small hats,
with a slight projection at the top, the brim of the
hat turned up, and scooped away in front.</p>

<p>Fillets of metal were worn about the hair with
some gold-work upon them to represent flowers;
or they wore, now and again, real chaplets of
flowers.</p>

<p>There was an increase of heraldic ornament in
this age, and the surcoats were often covered with
a large device.</p>

<p>These surcoats, as in the previous reign, were
split from shoulder to bottom hem, or were sewn
up below the waist; for these, thin silk, thick silk
(called samite), and sendal, or thick stuff, was used,
as also for the gowns.</p>

<p>The shoes were peaked, and had long toes, but
nothing extravagant, and they were laced on the
outside of the foot. The boots came in a peak
up to the knee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
The peasant was still very Norman in appearance,
hooded, cloaked, with ill-fitting tights and
clumsy shoes; his dress was often of bright colours
on festivals, as was the gown and head-handkerchief
of his wife.</p>

<p>Thus you see that, for ordinary purposes, a man
dressed in some gown which was long, loose, and
comfortable, the sleeves of it generally tight for
freedom, so that they did not hang about his arm,
and his shoes, hat, cloak, everything, was as soft
and free as he could get them.</p>

<p>The woman also followed in the lines of comfort:
her under-gown was full and slack at the waist,
the sleeves were tight, and were made to unbutton
from wrist to elbow; they stopped short at the
wrist with a cuff.</p>

<p>Her upper gown had short, wide sleeves, was
fastened at the back, and was cut but roughly
to the figure. The train of this gown was very
long.</p>

<p>They sought for comfort in every particular
but one: for though I think the gorget very becoming,
I think that it must have been most
distressing to wear. This gorget was a piece of
white linen wrapped about the throat, and pinned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
into its place; the ends were brought up to meet
a wad of hair over the ears and there fastened,
in this way half framing the face.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 220px;">
<img src="images/ecill039.png" width="220" height="250"
alt="Four types of hairstyle and head-dresses for women" />
</div>

<p>The hair was parted in the middle, and rolled
over pads by the ears, so as to make a cushion
on which to pin the gorget. This was the
general fashion.</p>

<p>Now, the earlier form
of head-dress gave rise
to another fashion. The
band which had been
tied round the head to
keep the wimple in place
was enlarged and stiffened
with more material, and so became a round
linen cap, wider at the top than at the bottom.
Sometimes this cap was hollow-crowned, so that
it was possible to bring the wimple under the
chin, fasten it into place with the cap, and allow
it to fall over the top of the cap in folds; sometimes
the cap was solidly crowned, and was
pleated; sometimes the cap met the gorget, and
no hair showed between them.</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">The sleeves of the man&rsquo;s overcoat through which he
has thrust his arms are complete sleeves, and could be
worn in the ordinary manner but that they are too
long to be convenient; hence the opening.</p>

<p>What we know as &lsquo;the true lovers&rsquo; knot&rsquo; was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
sometimes used as an ornament sewn on to dresses
or gowns.</p>

<p>You may know the effigy of Queen Eleanor
in Westminster Abbey, and if you do, you will
see an example of the very plainest dress of the
time. She has a shaped mantle over her shoulders,
which she is holding together by a strap; the long
mantle or robe
is over a plain,
loosely-pleated
gown, which fits
only at the shoulders;
her hair is
unbound, and she
wears a trefoil
crown upon her
head.</p>

<img src="images/ecill040.png" width="246" height="250"
alt="Two women of the time of Edward I." />
</div>

<p>The changes in
England can best be seen by such monuments
as Edward caused to be erected in memory of his
beloved wife. The arts of peace were indeed magnificent,
and though the knight was the man of war,
he knew how to choose his servant in the great arts.</p>

<p>Picture such a man as Alexander de Abyngdon,
&lsquo;le Imaginator,&rsquo; who with William de Ireland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
carved the statues of the Queen for five marks
each&mdash;such a man, with his gown hitched up into
his belt, his hood back on his shoulders, watching
his statue put into place on the cross at
Charing. He is standing by Roger de Crundale,
the architect of that cross, and he is directing the
workmen who are fixing the statue.... A little
apart you may picture Master William Tousell,
goldsmith, of London, a very important person,
who is making a metal statue of the Queen and
one of her father-in-law, Henry III., for Westminster
Abbey. At the back men and women in
hoods and wimples, in short tunics and loose gowns.
A very brightly-coloured picture, though the dyes
of the dresses be faded by rain and sun&mdash;they are
the finer colours for that: Master Tousell, no
doubt, in a short tunic for riding, with his loose
coat on him, the heavy hood back, a little cap on
his head; the workmen with their tunics off, a
twist of coloured stuff about their waists, their
heads bare.</p>

<p>It is a beautiful love-story this, of fierce Edward,
the terror of Scotland, for Eleanor, whom he
&lsquo;cherished tenderly,&rsquo; and &lsquo;whom dead we do not
cease to love.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
The same man, who could love so tenderly and
well, who found a fantastic order of chivalry in
the Round Table of Kenilworth, could there swear
on the body of a swan the death of Comyn,
Regent of Scotland, and could place the Countess
of Buchan, who set the crown upon the head of
Bruce, in a cage outside one of the towers of
Berwick.</p>

<p>Despite the plain cut of the garments of this
time, and the absence of superficial trimmings, it
must have been a fine sight to witness one hundred
lords and ladies, all clothed in silk, seated about the
Round Table of Kenilworth.</p>

<h2>EDWARD THE SECOND</h2>

<p class="smlfont center">Born 1284. Married, 1308, Isabella of France.</p>


<h3>MEN AND WOMEN</h3>

<p>Whether the changes in costume that took place
in this reign were due to enterprising tailors, or to
an exceptionally hot summer, or to the fancy of
the King, or to the sprightliness of Piers Gaveston,
it is not possible to say. Each theory is arguable,
and, no doubt, in some measure each theory is
right, for, although men followed the new
mode, ladies adhered to their earlier fashions.</p>

<p>Take the enterprising tailor&mdash;call him an artist.
The old loose robe was easy of cut; it afforded no
outlet for his craft; it cut into a lot of material,
was easily made at home&mdash;it was, in fact, a baggy
affair that fitted nowhere. Now, is it not possible
that some tailor-artist, working upon the vanity of
a lordling who was proud of his figure, showed how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
he could present this figure to its best advantage
in a body-tight garment which should reach only
to his hips?</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 148px;">
<img src="images/ecill041.png" width="148" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Edward II." />
</div>

<p>Take the hot summer. You may or may not
know that a hot summer some years ago suddenly
transformed the City of London from a place of
top-hats and black coats into
a place of flannel jackets and
hats of straw, so that it is now
possible for a man to arrive at
his City office clad according
to the thermometer, without
incurring the severe displeasure
of the Fathers of the
City.</p>

<p>It seems that somewhere
midway between 1307 and
1327 men suddenly dropped
their long robes, loosely tied at the waist, and
appeared in what looked uncommonly like vests,
and went by the name of &lsquo;cotehardies.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It must have been surprising to men who
remembered England clothed in long and decorous
robes to see in their stead these gay, debonair,
tight vests of pied cloth or parti-coloured silk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
Piers Gaveston, the gay, the graceless but graceful
favourite, clever at the tournament, warlike and
vain, may have instituted this complete revolution
in clothes with the aid of the weak King.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 160px;">

</div>

<p>Sufficient, perhaps, to say that, although long
robes continued to be
worn, cotehardies were
all the fashion.</p>

<p>There was a general tendency to exaggeration.
The hood was attacked by the dandies, and, instead
of its modest peak, they caused to be added a
long pipe of the material, which they called a
&lsquo;liripipe.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Every quaint thought and invention for tying
up this liripipe was used: they wound it about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
their heads, and tucked the end into the coil;
they put it about their necks, and left the end
dangling; they rolled it on to the top of their
heads.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 84px;">
<img src="images/ecill044.png" width="84" height="300"
alt="Four types of shoe; two types of hat" />
</div>

<p>The countryman, not behindhand in quaint
ideas, copied the form of a Bishop&rsquo;s hood, and
appeared with his cloth hood divided
into two peaks, one on either side of
his head.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 78px;">
<img src="images/ecill045.png" width="78" height="300"
alt="Four types of hood" />
</div>

<p>This new cotehardie was cut in
several ways. Strictly speaking, it was
a cloth or silk vest, tight to the body,
and close over the hips; the length
was determined by the fancy of the
wearer. It also had influence on the
long robes still worn, which, although
full below the waist to the feet, now
more closely fitted the body and
shoulders.</p>

<p>The fashionable sleeves were tight to
the elbow, and from there hanging and narrow,
showing a sleeve belonging to an undergarment.</p>

<p>The cloak also varied in shape. The heavy
travelling-cloak, with the hood attached, was of
the old pattern, long, shapeless, with or without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
hanging sleeves, loose at the neck, or tightly
buttoned.</p>

<p>Then there was a hooded cloak, with short
sleeves, or with the sleeves cut right away, a sort
of hooded surcoat. Then there were two distinct
forms of cape: one a plain, circular
cape, not very deep, which had a plain,
round, narrow collar of fur or cloth,
and two or three buttons at the neck;
and there was the round cape, without
a collar, but with turned back lapels of
fur. This form of cape is often to be
seen.</p>

<p>The boots and shoes were longer at
the toes, and were sometimes buttoned
at the sides.</p>

<p>The same form of hats remain, but
these were now treated with fur brims.</p>

<p>Round the waist there was always
a belt, generally of plain black leather; from it
depended a triangular pouch, through which a
dagger was sometimes stuck.</p>

EDWARD II. (1307-1327)</p>

<p class="subcapt">Notice the great length of liripipe on the man&rsquo;s
hood, also his short tunic of rayed cloth, his hanging
sleeve and his under-sleeve.</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">The woman has her hair dressed in two side-plaits,
to which the gorget or neckcloth is pinned.</p>

<p>The time of parti-coloured clothes was just
beginning, and the cotehardie was often made
from two coloured materials, dividing the body in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
two parts by the colour difference; it
was the commencement of the age
which ran its course during the next
reign, when men were striped diagonally,
vertically, and in angular bars;
when one leg was blue and the other
red.</p>

</div>

<p>You will note that all work was
improving in this reign when you hear
that the King paid the wife of John
de Bureford 100 marks for an embroidered
cope, and that a great green
hanging was procured for King&rsquo;s Hall,
London, for solemn feasts&mdash;a hanging
of wool, worked with figures of kings
and beasts. The ladies made little
practical change in their dress, except
to wear an excess of clothes against the
lack of draperies indulged in by the
men.</p>

<p>It is possible to see three garments,
or portions of them, in many dresses.
First, there was a stuff gown, with tight
sleeves buttoned to the elbow from the wrist;
this sometimes showed one or two buttons under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
the gorget in front, and was fitted, but not tightly,
to the figure. It fell in pleated folds to the feet,
and had a long train; this was worn alone, we
may suppose, in summer. Second, there was a
gown to go over this other, which had short, wide
sleeves, and was full in the skirts. One or other
of these gowns
had a train, but if
the upper gown
had a train the
under one had
not, and <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>. Third,
there was a surcoat like to a man&rsquo;s, not over-long
or full, with the sleeve-holes cut out wide; this
went over both or either of the other gowns.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 319px;">
<img src="images/ecill048.png" width="319" height="250"
alt="Two women of the time of Edward II.; a wimple with fillet and gorget" />
</div>

<p>Upon the head they wore the wimple, the fillet,
and about the throat the gorget.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the wimple and fillet were
new, for the hair was now plaited in two tails, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
these brought down straight on either side of the
face; the fillet was bound over the wimple in
order to show the plait, and the gorget met the
wimple behind the plait instead of over it.</p>

<p>The older fashion of hair-dressing remained, and
the gorget was pinned to the wads of hair over the
ears, without the covering of the wimple.</p>

<p>Sometimes the fillet was very wide, and placed
low on the head over a wimple tied like a gorget;
in this way the two side-plaits showed only in
front and appeared covered at side-face, while the
wimple and broad fillet hid all the top hair of
the head.</p>

<p>Very rarely a tall, steeple head-dress was worn
over the wimple, with a hanging veil; but this was
not common, and, indeed, it is not a mark of the
time, but belongs more properly to a later date.
However, I have seen such a head-dress drawn at
or about this time, so must include it.</p>

<p>The semicircular mantle was still in use, held
over the breast by means of a silk cord.</p>

<p>It may seem that I describe these garments in
too simple a way, and the rigid antiquarian would
have made comment on courtepys, on gamboised
garments, on cloth of Gaunt, or cloth of Dunster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
I may tell you that a gambeson was the quilted
tunic worn under armour, and, for the sake of
those whose tastes run into the arid fields of such
research, that you may call it wambasium, gobison,
wambeys, gambiex, gaubeson, or half a dozen other
names; but, to my mind, you will get no further
with such knowledge.</p>

<p>Falding is an Irish frieze; cyclas is a gown;
courtepy is a short gown; kirtle&mdash;again, if we know
too much we cannot be accurate&mdash;kirtle may be a
loose gown, or an apron, or a jacket, or a riding-cloak.</p>

<p>The tabard was an embroidered surcoat&mdash;that
is, a surcoat on which was displayed the heraldic
device of the owner.</p>

<p>Let us close this reign with its mournful end,
when Piers Gaveston feels the teeth of the Black
Dog of Warwick, and is beheaded on Blacklow
Hill; when Hugh le Despenser is hanged on a
gibbet; when the Queen lands at Orwell, conspiring
against her husband, and the King is a prisoner
at Kenilworth.</p>

<p>Here at Kenilworth the King hears himself
deposed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Edward, once King of England,&rsquo; is hereafter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
accounted &lsquo;a private person, without any manner
of royal dignity.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Here Edward, in a plain black gown, sees the
steward of his household, Sir Thomas Blount,
break his staff of office, done only when a King
is dead, and discharge all persons engaged in the
royal service.</p>

<p>Parliament decided to take this strong measure
in January; in the following September Edward
was murdered in cold blood at Berkeley Castle.</p>

<h2>EDWARD THE THIRD</h2>

<p class="smlfont center">Reigned fifty years: 1327-1377.</p>

<p class="smlfont center">Born 1312. Married, 1328, Philippa of Hainault.</p>


<h3>THE MEN</h3>

<p>Kings were Kings in those days; they managed
England as a nobleman managed his estates.</p>

<p>Edward I., during the year 1299, changed his
abode on an average three times a fortnight, visiting
in one year seventy-five towns and castles.</p>

<p>Edward II. increased his travelling retinue until,
in the fourth year of the reign of Edward III., the
crowd who accompanied that King had grown to
such proportions that he was forced to introduce a
law forbidding knights and soldiers to bring their
wives and families with them.</p>

<p>Edward III., with his gay company, would not
be stopped as he rode out of one of the gates of
London to pay toll of a penny a cart and a farthing
a horse, nor would any of his train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
This toll, which included threepence a week on
gravel and sand carts going in or out of the City,
was raised to help pay for street repairs, the streets
and roads of that time being in a continual state of
slush, mud, and pits of water.</p>

<p>Let us imagine Edward III. and his retinue
passing over Wakefield Bridge before he reduced
his enormous company.</p>

<p>The two priests, William Kaye and William
Bull, stand waiting for the King outside the new
Saint Mary&rsquo;s Chapel. First come the guard of four-and-twenty
archers in the King&rsquo;s livery; then a
Marshal and his servants (the other King&rsquo;s Marshal
has ridden by some twenty-four hours ago); then
comes the Chancellor and his clerks, and with
them a good horse carrying the Rolls (this was
stopped in the fourth year of Edward&rsquo;s reign);
then they see the Chamberlain, who will look to
it that the King&rsquo;s rooms are decent and in order,
furnished with benches and carpets; next comes
the Wardrobe Master, who keeps the King&rsquo;s
accounts; and, riding beside the King, the first
personal officer of the kingdom, the Seneschal;
after that a gay company of knights and their
ladies, merchants, monks dressed as ordinary laymen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
for travelling, soldiers of fortune, women,
beggars, minstrels&mdash;a motley gang of brightly-clothed
people, splashed with the mud and dust of
the cavalcade.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/ecill049.png" width="250" height="250"
alt="Two men of the time of Edward III." />
</div>

<p>Remembering the condition of the day, the
rough travelling, the estates far apart, the dirty
inns, one must not
imagine this company
spick and
span.</p>

<p>The ladies are
riding astride, the
gentlemen are in
civil garments or
half armour.</p>

<p>Let us suppose
that it is summer,
and but an hour or so after a heavy shower.
The heat is oppressive: the men have slung their
hats at their belts, and have pushed their hoods
from their heads; their heavy cloaks, which they
donned hastily against the rain, are off now, and
hanging across their saddles.</p>

<p>These cloaks vary considerably in shape. Here
we may see a circular cloak, split down the right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
side from the neck, it
buttons on the shoulder.
Here is another circular
cloak, jagged at the edge;
this buttons at the neck.
One man is riding in a
cloak, parti-coloured,
which is more like a
gown, as it has a hood
attached to it, and reaches
down to his feet.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 187px;">
<img src="images/ecill050.png" width="187" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Edward III.; two types of hood" />
</div>

<p>Nearly every man is alike in one
respect&mdash;clean-shaven, with long hair
to his neck, curled at the ears and on
the forehead.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 85px;">
<img src="images/ecill051.png" width="85" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Edward III." />
</div>

<p>Most men wear the cotehardie, the
well-fitting garment buttoned down the
front, and ending over the hips. There
is every variety of cotehardie&mdash;the long
one, coming nearly to the knees; the
short one, half-way up the thigh. Some
are buttoned all the way down the front,
and others only with two or three buttons at the neck.</p>

<p>Round the hips of every man is a leather belt,
from which hangs a pouch or purse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
Some of these purses are beautiful with stitched
arabesque designs; some have silver and enamel
clasps; some are plain black cloth or natural-coloured
leather; nearly all, however, are black.</p>

<p>The hoods over the men&rsquo;s heads vary in a number
of ways: some are very full in the cape, which is
jagged at the hem; some are close about the neck
and are plain; some have long liripipes falling from
the peak of the hood, and others have a liripipe of
medium length.</p>

<p>There are two or three kinds of hat worn, and
felt and fur caps of the usual shape&mdash;round, with
a rolled-up brim and a little peak on the top. Some
of the hats are tall-crowned, round hats with a
close, thick brim&mdash;these have strings through the
brim so that the hat may be strung on the belt
when it is not in use; other hats are of the long,
peaked shape, and now and again one may see a
feather stuck into them; a third variety shows the
brim of a high-crowned hat, castellated.</p>

<p>Among the knights you will notice the general
tendency to parti-coloured clothes, not only divided
completely into halves of two colours, but striped
diagonally, vertically, and horizontally, so giving a
very diverse appearance to the mass of colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
Here and there a man is riding in his silk
surcoat, which is embroidered with his coat of
arms or powdered with his badge.</p>

<p>Here are cloth, velvet, silk, and woollen stuffs,
all of fine dyes, and here is some fine silk cotehardie
with patterns upon it gilt in gold leaf, and
there is a magnificent piece of stuff, rich in design,
from the looms of Palermo.</p>

<p>Among the merchants we shall see some more
sober colours and quieter cut of clothes; the archers
in front are in leather tunics, and these quiet colours
in front, and the respectable merchants behind,
enclose the brilliant blaze of colour round the King.</p>

<p>Behind all come the peasants, minstrels, mummers,
and wandering troupes of acrobats; here is a bearward
in worn leather cloak and hood, his legs
strapped at the ankle, his shoes tied on with
thongs; here is a woman in a hood, open at the
neck and short at the back: she wears a smocked
apron; here is a beggar with a hood of black stuff
over his head&mdash;a hood with two peaks, one on either
side of his head; and again, here is a minstrel
with a patched round cloak, and a mummer with
a two-peaked hood, the peaks stuffed out stiff,
with bells jangling on the points of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
Again, among this last group, we must notice
the old-fashioned loose tunics, the coif over the
head, tied under the chin, wooden-soled shoes and
pouch-gloves.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 287px;">
<img src="images/ecill052.png" width="287" height="250"
alt="Three men of the time of Edward III." />
</div>

<p>There are some Norfolk merchants and some
merchants from Flanders among the crowd, and
they talk as best they can in a sort of French-Latin-English
jargon among themselves; they speak
of England as the great wool-producing country,
the tax on which produced &pound;30,000 in one year;
they talk of the tax, its uses and abuses, and how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
Norfolk was proved the richest county in wool by
the tax of 1341.</p>

<p>The people of England little thought to hear
artillery used in a field of battle so soon as 1346,
when on August 26 it was used for the first time,
nor did they realize the horrors that were to come
in 1349, when the Great Plague was to
sweep over England and kill half the
population.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 91px;">
<img src="images/ecill053.png" width="91" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Edward III." />
</div>

<p>There is one man in this crowd who
has been marked by everybody. He is
a courtier, dressed in the height of
fashion. His cotehardie fits him very
well: the sleeves are tight from elbow
to wrist, as are the sleeves of most of
his fellows&mdash;some, however, still wear
the hanging sleeve and show an under-sleeve&mdash;and
his sleeve is buttoned from wrist to
elbow. He wears the newest fashion upon his arm,
the tippet, a piece of silk which is made like a
detachable cuff with a long streamer hanging from
it; his cotehardie is of medium length, jagged
at the bottom, and it is of the finest Sicilian
silk, figured with a fine pattern; round his hips
he wears a jewelled belt. His hood is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
parti-coloured and jagged at the edge and round his
face, and his liripipe is very long. His tights
are parti-coloured, and his shoes, buttoned up the
front, are long-toed and are made of red-and-white
chequered leather. By him rides a knight, also
in the height of fashion, but less noticeable: he
has his cotehardie skirt split up in front and
turned back; he has
not any buttons on
his sleeves, and his
belt about his waist
holds a large square
pouch; his shoes are
a little above his
ankles, and are
buckled over the instep.
His hair is
shorter than is
usual, and it is not
curled.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/ecill054.png" width="225" height="275"
alt="A man of the time of Edward III.; three types of head-gear" />
</div>

<p>As we observe these knights, a party of
armed knights come riding down the road towards
the cavalcade; they have come to greet the
King.</p>

<p>These men have ridden through the rain, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
now, as they come closer, one can see that their
armour is already red with rust.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 60px;">
<img src="images/ecill055.png" width="60" height="100"
alt="A hat" />
</div>

<p>So the picture should remain on your mind,
as I have imagined it for you: the knights in
armour and surcoats covered with their heraldic
device; the archers; the gay crowd of knights
in parti-coloured clothes; the King, in his
cotehardie of plain black velvet and his black
beaver hat, just as he looked after Calais in later
years; the merchants; the servants in
parti-coloured liveries of their masters&rsquo;
colours; the tattered crowd behind;
and, with the aid of the drawings, you
should be able to visualize the picture.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Edward will arrive at his destination,
and to soothe him before sleep, he will read out
of the book of romances, illustrated by Isabella,
the nun of Aumbresbury, for which he had paid
&pound;66 13s. 4d., which sum was heavy for those
days, when &pound;6 would buy twenty-four swans.
&pound;66 13s. 4d. is about &pound;800 of our money to-day.</p>

<p>There are two manuscripts in existence the
illuminations in which give the most wonderfully
pictorial idea of this time; they are the manuscript
marked MS. Bodl., Misc. 264, in the Bodleian
Library at Oxford, and the Loutrell Psalter in the
British Museum.</p>

<p>The Loutrell Psalter is, indeed, one of the most
notable books in the world; it is an example of
illumination at the height of that art; it has for
illustrator a person, not only of a high order of
intelligence, but a person possessed of the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
spirit of Gothic humour, who saw rural England,
not only with the eyes of an artist, but with the
eyes of a gossiping philosopher.</p>

<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF EDWARD III. (1327-1377)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">Round his arms you will see the curious tippet, the
jagged ends of which hang down; these are the
remains of the pendant sleeves. His shoes are
buttoned in front.</p>

<p>Both this book and the book in the Bodleian
Library were illustrated by persons who were
charged to the brim with the spirit of their age;
they were Chaucerian in their gay good-humour
and in their quaint observation, and they have that
moral knowledge and outspoken manner which
characterize William Langland, whose &lsquo;Piers the
Plowman&rsquo; I have quoted above.</p>

<p>With Chaucer, Langland, and these illuminators
we have a complete exhibition of English life of
these times. The pulse of rural England is felt by
them in a most remarkable way; the religion, language,
thought, politics, the whole trend of rural,
provincial, and Court life may be gathered from
their books.</p>

<p>The drawings in the Loutrell Psalter were completed
before the year 1340, and they give us all
that wonderful charm, that intimate knowledge,
which we enjoy in the &lsquo;Canterbury Pilgrims&rsquo; and
the &lsquo;Vision of Piers Plowman.&rsquo;</p>

<p>There seems to be something in road-travelling
which levels all humanity; there is no road in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
England which does not throb with history; there
is no poem or story written about roads in England
which does not in some way move the Englishness
in us. Chaucer and Langland make comrades of
us as they move along the highway, and with them
we meet, on terms of intimacy, all the characters of
the fourteenth century. With these illuminators
of the Loutrell Psalter and the Bodleian MS. we
see actually the stream of English life along a
crowded thoroughfare.</p>

<p>In these books we may see drawings of every
form of agricultural life and manorial existence: we
see the country sports, the bear-baiting, and the
cock-fighting; we see the harvesters with straw
hats, scythes, and reaping-hooks; we see carters,
carriers, and great carriages, all depicted in a manner
which we can only compare, in later years, to the
broad humour of Hogarth; and, as we turn the
priceless pages over, the whole fourteenth-century
world passes before our eyes&mdash;japers and jugglers;
disours and jesters; monk, priest, pilgrim, and
pardoner; spendthrift and wench; hermits, good
and evil; lords, ladies, and Kings.</p>

<p>I have written of the men and their dress&mdash;how
they were often&mdash;very often&mdash;dirty, dusty, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
travel-stained&mdash;of the red-rusted armour and the
striped and chequered clothes, and now I must
write of the women and the manner of their
dress.</p>

<p>Of the time, you must remember that it was the
time of chivalry, when there was a Round Table of
Knights at Windsor, founded in 1345; when the
Order of the Garter was founded; when tiltings
and all manner of tournaments were at their height;
and you listen to the minstrels of King Edward&rsquo;s
household playing upon the trumpet, the cytole,
the pipe, the taberet, the clarion, and the fiddle.</p>

<p>St. George, the Primate of Egypt in the fourth
century, had now risen to public esteem and
notice, so that he became in this time not only
the patron saint of chivalry, but the tutelar saint
of England.</p>

<p>Boys were taken from the care of the ladies of
the household at the age of seven, when they became
pages to knights, and were sworn to devote themselves
to the graces and favours of some girl. At
fourteen the boy became a squire, and at twenty-one,
if he were possessed of a rental of &pound;20 a year
in land, he made his fast and vigil, and was afterward
dubbed knight and given his spurs.</p>

alt="Twelve hair arrangements for women" />
</div>

<p>The noteworthy point about a woman of this
reign was her hair. The Queen herself wore an
elaborate mode of coiffure for that time; she wore a
metal fillet round her head, to which was attached
two cases, circular in shape, of gold fretwork,
ornamented with precious stones. She wore her
hair unplaited, and brought in two parts from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
back of her head, and as far as one can see, pushed
into the jewelled cases.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 119px;">
<img src="images/ecill057.png" width="119" height="400"
alt="Five sleeve types for women" />
</div>

<p>The most general form of hair-dressing was an
excess on the mode of the previous reign, a richness
of jewel-work, an abundance of gold
wire. It was usual to divide the
hair into two plaits, and arrange
these on either side of the face,
holding them in their place by
means of a fillet; they might be
worn folded straight up by the
face, or at an angle, but they were
never left hanging; if hair was left
loose it was not plaited, but
flowing.</p>

<p>The gorget, or throat cloth, was
still in general use, and it was attached
to the hair by very elaborate-headed
pins. Sometimes the
hair, dressed with the gorget, was
divided into four plaits, two on either side of the
face, and fastened horizontally.</p>

<p>The wimple of silk or linen was very generally
worn. A caul of gold net came into fashion, but
not until the end of the reign. The ladies were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
great upon hunting and hawking, and this must
have been a convenient fashion to keep the hair in
order. Some wore a white silk or linen cap, so
shaped as to include and cover the two side-plaits
and combine a gorget and wimple in one. Pointed
frontals of pearls were worn across the forehead,
and fillets of silk or linen were so tied that long
ends hung down the back.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;">
<img src="images/ecill058.png" width="433" height="250"
alt="Four women of the time of Edward III." />
</div>

<p>Yellow hair was much esteemed, and ladies who
were not favoured by Nature, brought saffron to
their aid, and by such efforts brought Nature into
line with Art.</p>

<p>There was the general custom of wearing the
surcoat in imitation of the men, a garment I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
described frequently&mdash;a slightly-fitting garment
without sleeves&mdash;you will see how this grew later
into a gorgeous affair. These surcoats
were sometimes of fine cloth of gold
covered with an intricate, delicate pattern
in which beasts, birds, and foliage
mingled in arabesque. Under this surcoat
was a plainer, better-fitting
garment, made sometimes of the barred
and rayed material so common to the
men, or of velvet, cloth, or silk, in
plain colours, green and red being then
very favourite; ermines and many other furs were
used to border these gowns. Sometimes you may
see that this gown had sleeves short at the elbow,
exposing a different coloured under-sleeve, buttoned
from elbow to wrist; at other times&mdash;in fact, among
all fashionable persons&mdash;the curious fashion of the
tippet, or long streamer, was worn. I have carefully
described this fashion in the previous chapter.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 90px;">
<img src="images/ecill059.png" width="90" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of Edward III." />
</div>

<p>The plain gown with tight sleeves was most in
use, and the skirts of this gown were very voluminous,
and had either pockets or holes in the front of
them; the holes enabled the wearer to reach the
purse hanging from a girdle which encircled the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
waist of the under-dress. These gowns were
generally buttoned in front, from neck to waist,
or they were laced.</p>

<p>They also wore a heavier gown which reached
just below the knee, showing the skirts of the
under-gown; the heavy gowns were often fur-lined,
and had loose wide sleeves to the elbow.</p>

<p>There was at this time a curious fur or cloth
cape in use, longer behind than in front&mdash;in fact,
it varied with the taste of the owner. It was cut
in even scallops all round; I say even to show that
they were sewn-edged, not jagged and rough-edged.
Any pair of these scallops might be longer than
any other pair. Ladies wore these capes for
hunting, and ornamented the ends with bells.</p>

<p>The shoes of the women were not very exaggerated
in length, but, as a rule, fitted well to
the foot and came out in a slight point. You may
use for this reign shoes buckled across the instep,
laced at the side, or buttoned up the front.</p>

<p>For riding and sport the ladies wore the hood, and
sometimes a broad round hat over it, or the peaked
hat. The countrywoman wore an ill-fitting gown
with tight sleeves, an apron, and an open hood.</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">You will notice that the woman also wears the tippet

<p>Imagine London in the year of the third great
pestilence, 1369. It is October, and the worst of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
the pestilence is over; John Chichester, the Mayor,
is riding through the streets about some great
affairs; many knights and ladies pass by. It is
raining hard after the long drought of the summer,
but, despite the rain, many citizens are abroad to
see the doings in the City, and one may see the
bright parti-coloured clothes of the lords and ladies,
and here and there, as a cloak is blown back, a
glimpse of rich-patterned cloth of gold.</p>

<p>Perhaps Will Langland&mdash;Long Will&mdash;a gaunt
man of thirty-seven, is brushing past a young man
of twenty-nine, Chaucer, going to his work.</p>

<p>Silk dresses and frieze gowns, velvet and homespun,
hurry along as the rain falls more heavily,
and after a while the street becomes quite deserted.
Then nothing but the dreary monotony of the
rain falling from the gables will come to the room
of the knight&rsquo;s lady as she lies sick of small-pox.
John de Gaddesden, the King&rsquo;s doctor, has prescribed
for her that she must lie clothed in scarlet
red in a room of that colour, with bed-hangings of
that same colour, and so she must lie, without
much comfort, while the raindrops, falling down
the wide chimney, drip on the logs in the fire and
make them hiss.</p>

<h2>RICHARD THE SECOND</h2>

<p class="smlfont center">Reigned twenty-two years: 1377-1399.</p>

<h3>THE MEN</h3>

<p>The King himself was a leader of fashion; he had
by grace of Nature the form, face, and manner
which go to make a dandy. The nobles followed
the King; the merchants followed the nobles after
their kind; the peasants were still clothed in the
simplest of garments, having retained the Norman
tunic with the sleeves pushed back over the wrist,
kept the loose boots and straw gaiters, and showed
the improvement in their class by the innovation
of gloves made as a thumb with a pouch for the
fingers, and pouches for money of cloth and leather
hung on a leather belt. This proved the peasant
to be a man of some substance by need of his
wallet. Everyone wore the chaperon&mdash;a cap and
cape combined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
We have now arrived at the reign which made
such a difference to the labourer and workman&mdash;such
as the blacksmith and miller&mdash;and in consequence
altered and improved the character of
his clothes. The poll-tax of 1380 brought the
labourer into individual notice for the first time,
and thus arose the free labourer in England and
the first labour pamphlets.</p>

<p>We have two word-pictures of the times of the
greatest value, for they show both sides of the
coin: the one by the courtly and comfortable
Chaucer, the other by Long Will&mdash;William Langland,
or Piers the Plowman. Picture the two
along the Strand&mdash;Long Will singing his dirges
for hire, and Chaucer, his hand full of parchments,
bustling past.</p>

<p>One must remember that, as always, many
people dressed out of the fashion; that many men
still wore the cotehardie, a well-fitting garment
reaching half-way down the thigh, with tight
sleeves coming over the hand, decorated with
buttons under the sleeve from the elbow to the
little finger. This garment had a belt, which was
placed round the hips; and this was adorned in
many ways: principally it was composed of square
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
pieces of metal joined together, either of silver, or
enamel in copper, or of gold set with precious
stones.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 70px;">
<img src="images/ecill060.png" width="70" height="250"

</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/ecill061.png" width="250" height="157"
alt="Three types of footwear; a coat" />
</div>

<p>The cotehardie was generally made of a pied
cloth in horizontal or diagonal bars, in silk or other
rich fabric. With this garment the
chaperon (to be more fully described)
was worn as a hood; the legs were in
tights, and the feet in pointed shoes a
little longer than the foot. A pouch or
wallet depended from the belt, and a
sheath containing two daggers, an anelace,
and a misericorde. The pouch was a
very rich affair, often of stamped gilded
leather or sewn velvet&mdash;ornamented, in
fact, according to the purse of the wearer. In winter
such a man as he of the cotehardie would wear an
overcoat with an attached
hood. This coat was
made in various forms:
one form with wide sleeves
the same width all the
way down, under which
were slits in the coat to enable the wearer to place
his hands inside, as in the modern Raglan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
coat-pocket. Another form was made very loose and
without sleeves, but with the same slits at the
side; it was buckled round the waist on occasion
by a broad leather belt, very
plain. The common heavy
travelling-coat was made in
this way, and it was only the
very fashionable who wore
the houppelande for riding or
travelling. Sometimes such a man would wear
in winter about the town a cloak fastened over
the right shoulder with three or four buttons,
leaving the right arm free; such a cloak is seen in
the brass of Robert Attelathe, Mayor of Lynn.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/ecill062.png" width="250" height="206"
alt="A draped cloak and simple pattern for it" />
</div>

<p>In travelling, our gentleman would wear, often
in addition to his chaperon, a peaked hat of cloth,
high in the crown, with a brim turned up all round,
ending in a long peak in front&mdash;the same hat that
we always associate with Dick Whittington.</p>

<p>His gloves would be of leather, often ornamented
with designs on the back, or, if he were a knight,
with his badge.</p>

<p>On this occasion he would wear his sword in a
baldric, a long belt over his right shoulder and
under his left arm, from which hung also his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
daggers. Although I am not dealing even with
personal arms, one must remember, in representing
these people, that daggers were almost as necessary
a part of dress as boots or shoes, and that personal
comfort often depended upon a skilful use of that
natty weapon; the misericorde was used to give
the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i>.</p>

<p>The farmer in harvest-time wore, if he did not
wear a hood, a peaked hat or a round, large-brimmed
straw hat.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 210px;">
<img src="images/ecill063.png" width="210" height="275" alt="" />
<span class="caption">The Houppelande or Peli&ccedil;on.</span>
</div>

<p>We may now arrive at the fashionable man,
whose eccentricities in clothes were the object of
much comment. How the
houppelande or peli&ccedil;on
actually was originated I
do not know, but it came
about that men suddenly
began to clothe themselves
in this voluminous
and awkward garment.
It was a long loose-fitting
robe, made to fit on
the shoulders only, having
very long loose sleeves, varying according to
the whim of the owner. These sleeves were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
cut at the edges into the forms of leaves or
other designs, and were lined, as the houppelande,
with fur or silk. It will be seen that such a
garment to suit all weathers and temperatures
must be made of various materials and lined
accordingly. These materials were almost invariably
powdered with badges or some other device,
sometimes with a flowing pattern embracing an
heraldic design or motto. The sleeves turned back
disclosed the sleeve of a cotehardie underneath,
with the little buttons running from the elbow to
the first knuckle of the little finger. The houppelande
had a very high collar, coming well up to the
middle of the back of the head; it was buttoned up
to the chin in front, and the collar was often turned
down half-way, the two top buttons being left
undone. It was fastened about the middle by a
thin leather belt, very long; this was buckled, and
the long end turned under and brought over to
hang down; the end was ornamented with many
devices&mdash;figures of saints, heraldic figures, or other
ornaments. Sometimes the entire belt was sewn
with small devices in precious metal or enamels.</p>

<p>Now, to be in the height of fashion, one either
wore the houppelande extremely long in the skirt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
or extremely short&mdash;so short, in fact, as to leave
but a frill of it remaining below the waist&mdash;leaving
the sleeves still their abnormal length. Pretty
fads, as tying a dagger round the neck, or allowing
it to hang low between the legs, or placing it in
the small of the back, were much in vogue.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/ecill064.png" width="250" height="94"
alt="Two types of long shoe" />
</div>

<p>Every form of beard or moustache was used, and
the hair was worn long to the nape of the neck.
By the dandy it was elaborately pressed and curled
at the ends. Bands of real or artificial flowers
encircled the heads of the dandies, the artificial
flowers made in enamels or gold. Rings were
worn of great size on thumb and finger; long staffs
with elaborate heads were carried.</p>

<p>Under the houppelande was the skirt and the
cotehardie of thin material, and on the legs hose,
pied or powdered,
made of silk or cloth
cut to the form and
sewn.</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">His chaperon, or hood, is twisted and tied about his
head with the liripipe, the elongated peak of his
hood, thrown over his shoulders.</p>

<p>The shoes were of great length, with long
points; rarely we find examples of the absurd
fashion of wearing the points so long that they
were tied back to the knees, but often they were
so long that the points came out 6 inches beyond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
the toe. They were made of every material, sewn
with pearls on cloth or velvet, stamped with gold
on leather, or the leather raised. The toes were
sometimes stuffed hard, sometimes allowed to hang
limp.</p>

<p>For walking in the streets high clogs of wood
were used, made with long pointed ends to support
the shoes.</p>

<p>I may add that the hose were gartered below the
knee to hold them taut with rich garters, but if a
man were a Garter Knight he wore but the garter
of his Order.</p>

<p>Much in favour with this court of gallants were
rich chains about the neck, having for pendant
their badge or some saint&rsquo;s figure in gold or silver.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 307px;">
<img src="images/ecill066.png" width="307" height="200"
alt="Five types of head-wear" />
</div>

<p>Now we come to the most interesting and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
universal fashion of wearing the chaperon, which I
am anxious to show in its various stages. It began
with a cape and a hood worn separately; these
were joined for convenience so that a man might
put on both at once. This fashion held for many
years, and then the fashionable man in search of
novelty caused the peak of the hood to be
lengthened until it grew to reach to his feet. Then
he cast about for a fresh mode for his head-wear,
and so he twisted
the whole affair
about his head,
leaving the end of the
cape, which was jagged
at the edge, protruding
like a cockscomb. Time
went on, and he avoided
the trouble of tying this himself, so he had the
hat made up all ready tied, much in the manner
of a turban. Finally, the chaperon grew into
disuse, and it remains to-day a curious reminder
in the cockade worn by coachmen (it is almost a
replica in miniature, with the round twist and the
jagged edge sticking up above the hat) and on the
cloaks of the Knights of the Garter, where it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
carefully made, and forms a cape on the right
shoulder, and in the present head-dress of the
French lawyer, a relic of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The chains worn about the neck remain as
badges of office in Mayors and Judges and in
various Orders.</p>

<p>The button worn by the members of the Legion
of Honour and other foreign Orders is, I believe, an
idea resulting from the cockade,
which, of course, was at the beginning
the chaperon in the colours of
the servant&rsquo;s lord.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 138px;">
<img src="images/ecill067.png" width="138" height="225"
alt="A houppelande showing the leg opening" />
</div>

<p>When one knows a custom so
well, one is apt to leave out many
things in describing it. For example,
the houppelande was open from the
bottom of the skirt to the knee in front or at the
side, and this opening was often cut or jagged into
shapes; also it was open all the way up the side of
the leg, and from the neck to the breast, and
buttoned over.</p>

<p>I have not remarked on the jester, a member of
many households, who wore an exaggeration of the
prevalent costume, to which bells were attached at
all points.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
So was much good cloth wasted in vanity, and
much excellent time spent upon superfluities, to
the harm of the people; perhaps useful enough
to please the eye, which must have been regaled
with all these
men in wonderful
colours,
strutting peacockwise.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 390px;">
<img src="images/ecill068.png" width="390" height="250"

</div>

<p>The poor
peasant, who
found cloth
becoming very dear, cared not one jot or tittle for
the feast of the eye, feeling a certain unreasonable
hunger elsewhere.</p>

<p>And so over the wardrobe of Dandy Richard
stepped Henry, backed by the people.</p>


<h3>THE WOMEN</h3>

<p>If ever women were led by the nose by the
demon of fashion it was at this time. Not only
were their clothes ill-suited to them, but they
abused that crowning glory, their hair.</p>

<p>No doubt a charming woman is always charming,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
be she dressed by woad or worth; but to be
captivating with your eyebrows plucked out, and
with the hair that grows so prettily low on the
back of the neck
shaved away&mdash;was
it possible? I expect
it was.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/ecill069.png" width="300" height="120"
alt="Two types of head-dress for women, showing different views and a detail" />
</div>

<p>The days of high
hennins was yet to come; the day of simple hair-dressing
was nearly dead, and in the interval were
all the arts of the cunning devoted to the guimpe,
the gorgi&egrave;res, the mentonni&egrave;res,
the voluminous escoffions.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 156px;">
<img src="images/ecill070.png" width="156" height="250"
alt="Two types of head-dress for women, showing different views and a detail" />
</div>

<p>At this time the lady wore her
hair long and hanging freely over
her shoulders; her brows were
encircled by a chaplet, or chapel
of flowers, real or artificial, or by
a crown or plain circlet of gold;
or she tucked all her hair away
under a tight caul, a bag of gold net enriched with
precious stones. To dress hair in this manner it
was first necessary to plait it in tight plaits and
bind them round the head, then to cover this with
a wimple, which fell over the back of the neck, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
over this to place the caul, or, as it was sometimes
called, the dorelet. Now and again the caul
was worn without the wimple, and this left the
back of the neck exposed;
from this all the
hair was plucked.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/ecill071.png" width="250" height="91"
alt="Three types of head-dress for women" />
</div>

<p>For outdoor exercises
the lady would wear the chaperon (explained in the
previous chapter), and upon this the peaked hat.</p>

<p>The poorer woman wore always the hood, the
wimple tied under the chin, or plain plaited hair.</p>

<p>One must remember always
that the advance of costume
only affected the upper classes
in the towns, and that the
knight&rsquo;s lady in the country
was often fifty years behind
the times in her gowns. As an
instance of this I give the fur
tippet hung with bells, used
when hawking.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 145px;">
<img src="images/ecill072.png" width="145" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of Richard II." />
</div>

<p>In the early part of the reign
the cotehardie was the universal woman&rsquo;s garment.
It was made in two ways: the one a simple, well-fitting
garment, skirts and bodice in one, buttoned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
in front, with neck well open, the skirts ample and
long, the sleeves over the hands to the first joints
of the fingers, and ornamented with buttons from
the elbow to the little finger&mdash;this was the general
form of the garment for all degrees of rank. The
lady enriched this with a belt like a man&rsquo;s, narrow
in width round the waist with hanging end, or
broad round the hips and richly ornamented. The
other form of
cotehardie was
exactly as the
man&rsquo;s, ending
short below the
hips, under
which was worn
the petticoat.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 268px;">
<img src="images/ecill073.png" width="268" height="225"
alt="Three types of dress for women" />
</div>

<p>The winter
addition to these
was the surcoat (as usually worn by a knight over
his armour); this was often lined with fur. The
surcoat was a long garment without sleeves, and
with a split down the sides from the shoulder to
the top of the thigh; through this split was
seen the cotehardie and the hip-belt. The
edges were trimmed with fur, and very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
frequently ornamental buttons were worn down the
front.</p>

<p>Over the shoulders was the cloak, left open in
front, and fastened by means of a cord of rich
substance passing through two loops in the backs
of large ornamental studs; this cord was, as a rule,
knotted at the waist, the
ends hanging down as
tassels.</p>

</div>

<p>Later in the reign, when
the second Queen of
Richard had brought over
many rich fashions, the
ladies adopted the houppelande,
with its heavy collar
and wide, hanging sleeves.
Every lady and most women carried a purse in the
hand or on the girdle, ornamented according to
their station.</p>

<p>The merchant&rsquo;s wife wore, in common with her
maids, a white apron. The child who was spinning
a peg-top in the street was simply dressed in a
short-skirted cotehardie.</p>

<p class="caption">A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF RICHARD II. (1377-1399)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">Her loose surcoat is cut away to show her under-dress.
Her hair is completely hidden by her jewelled
caul.</p>

<p>For riding and sport the woman was dressed
almost exactly as a man&mdash;with houppelande or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
heavy cloak buttoned on the right shoulder,
hawking-glove on her left hand with a bell or
metal ball depending from it. She wore boots
laced up at the side, or long boots of soft leather
fastened with hook and eye; shoes like a man&rsquo;s,
but not so pointed and extreme. Sometimes for
riding a big round hat was worn over a hood.</p>

<p>In many cases the dresses were powdered with
the monogram of the Blessed Virgin, with badges
of the family or some small device, or they were
ornamented with a simple flowing pattern, or were
plain.</p>

<p>All the fripperies of fashion lay in pins for the
wimple, the head made as a figure of a patron
saint; or girdles rich with precious stones; or
mirror-cases on whose ivory fronts were carved
the Castle of Love, or hunting scenes, or Calvary.
The clasps of purses were rich in design, and rings
of every kind were worn on every finger and
upon the thumb. Charms against evil were hung
about the neck or sewn into the clothes. No
matter who wrote, passed, and practised the many
sumptuary laws, still, one may know it to have
been frequent for persons owning less than &pound;20
a year to wear gold and silver ornaments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
although expressly forbidden, and ladies of a lower
estate than wives of knights-banneret wore cloth
of gold and velvet, and gowns that reached and
trailed upon the ground, while their husbands
braved it in ermine and marten-lined sleeves which
swept the road.</p>

<p>The custom of wearing crowns was common to
all people of rank, as heraldic distinction of crowns
did not commence until the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>What a magnificent time for colour was this
reign!&mdash;the rich houppelandes, the furs, the long-piked
shoes with pearls and gold upon them, the
massive chains about men&rsquo;s necks; ladies whose
heads shone with rich caps and cauls of pearl-embroidered
gold, the rich-sheathed baselard stuck
in the girdle or hanging from it on a silver chain.
Even the poor begging friar was touched by all
this finery, and, forgetful of the rules of Saint
Francis, he made great haste to convert his alms
into a furred cote &lsquo;cutted to the knee and quaintly
buttoned, hose in hard weather fastened at the
ankle, and buckled shoes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Imagine that amazing woman the Wife of Bath,
in her great hat and pound-weight kerchief; the
carpenter&rsquo;s wife in her gored apron, at her girdle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
a purse of leather hanging, decorated with silk
tassels and buttons of metal.</p>

<p>It is almost impossible to describe clearly the
head-dresses&mdash;the great gold net bags which encased
the hair&mdash;for they were ornamented in such different
ways, always, or nearly always, following some
pattern in diaper in contrast to the patterns which
came later when the design followed such lines as
are formed by wire-netting, while later still the
connecting-thread of the patterns was done away
with and the inside decoration alone remained.</p>

<p>Well, Richard the King no longer can whistle
to Matthew, his favourite greyhound, and Anne
the Queen lies stately in the Abbey at Westminster
without solace of her little lap-dog; but we are
not all modern in our ways, and ladies hang charms
about them, from scarabs to queer evil eye coral
hands, from silver shoes to month-stones. Crowns
of flowers have been worn and crowns of jewels
too, just as men and women wore them then, except
on Fridays and the eves of f&ecirc;tes.</p>

<p>These things we do, and other ancient things
beside, but let us hope that Fashion has lost her
cruel mood, and deems it wise to leave our ladies&rsquo;
eyebrows where they be, nor schemes to inspire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
her faithful devotees with mad desires to hide their
hair and shave their napes.</p>

<p>The crinoline is threatened&mdash;let it come; sandals
are here, with short hair and the simple life, but
leave me, I pray thee, royal dame, an eyebrow
on my lady, if only to give occupation to the love-lorn
sonneteer.</p>

<h2>THE END OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 110px;">
<img src="images/ecill075.png" width="110" height="250" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Chaucer.</span>
</div>

<p>In the last year of the fourteenth
century there were still living two
men whose voices have made the
century live for us. One of them&mdash;Chaucer&mdash;remains
to-day the
father of English poetry, the forerunner
of Shakespeare; the other&mdash;Gower&mdash;less
known to most of
us, was the author of three long
poems&mdash;&lsquo;Speculum Meditantis,&rsquo; in
French; &lsquo;Vox Clamantis,&rsquo; in Latin;
&lsquo;Confessio Amantis,&rsquo; in English.
Boccaccio had written his &lsquo;Decameron,&rsquo;
and it was this method of writing a series
of poems or stories by means of connecting-links of
narrative that should run through the series, that inspired
the form of the &lsquo;Confessio Amantis&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;Canterbury Tales&rsquo;; indeed, many stories in both
of these works are retold out of the &lsquo;Decameron.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
Gower wrote of his age as a man giving advice,
philosophically; he did not attempt character
studies, but framed his poems as narratives with
morals fit for application to his times.</p>

<p>Chaucer drew his characters clearly&mdash;so clearly
that they have become as living as have Uncle
Toby or Mrs. Gamp&mdash;symbolic people, embracing
a type of national character.</p>

<p>A third writer&mdash;Langland&mdash;pictured his age
from the poor man&rsquo;s point of view, and the three
writers, together with the artist of the Loutrell
Psalter, bring the age most vividly to our eyes.</p>

<p>Of course, in these days of hasty work, it seems
hardly feasible to suggest that artists who would
illustrate these times should read the works of
these three men, and go to the British Museum
to look at the Psalter; but any writer must do
this, and can do this, considering that the works
of the poets are cheap to obtain and the British
Museum is free to all.</p>

<p>Anyone wishing to picture these times will find
that Chaucer has written very carefully of the
costume of his Pilgrims. They will find the pith
of the costume in this book of mine; but since no
book is complete in every sense, they should see for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
themselves how men of the day drew the costume
they saw about them. It will give them a sense
of the spirit of the age which so many modern
drawings lack.</p>

<p>I give you Gower&rsquo;s picture of an exquisite; no
words of mine could show so well the manner
of the man:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;And therof thenketh he but a lite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all his lust is to delite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In new&eacute; thing&eacute;s, proude and veine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Als ferforth as he may atteine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I trowe, if that he might&eacute; make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His body newe, he wold&eacute; take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A new&eacute; form and leve his olde.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what thing that he may behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The which to common use is straunge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anone his old&eacute; guis&eacute; chaunge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He woll, and fall&eacute; therupon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lich unto the camelion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whiche upon every sondry hewe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he beholt he mot&eacute; newe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His coloun; and thus unavised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full oft&eacute; time he stand desguised.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More jolif than the brid in Maie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He maketh him ever fressh and gaie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And doth all his array desguise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that of him the new&eacute; guise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lusty folke all other take.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
Now, if I have described the costume of these
times clearly&mdash;and I think I have done so&mdash;these
lines should conjure up a gay fellow, with his many
changes of dress. If the vision fails, then allow
me to say that you are at fault, and have taken no
pains with the description. Because the coloured
drawing to the chapter of Richard II. shows a
long houppelande and a chaperon tied in a certain
way, you will very possibly forget that this dandy
would have also a short houppelande, differently
jagged sleeves, more ruffle about the twisting of
his chaperon, more curve to the points of his shoes.</p>

<p>You may see the image of Gower for yourself in
St. Mary Overies Church, now called St. Saviour&rsquo;s,
on the Southwark side of London Bridge. He is
dressed in his sober black, his head resting upon
his three books.</p>

<p>In 1397 Gower retired from active life, and resigned
his Rectory of Great Braxted, Essex; he was
seventy years of age, and at that age he married Agnes
Groundolf in a chapel of his own under the rooms
where he lived in the Priory of St. Mary Overies.</p>

<p>In 1400 his friend Chaucer died and Gower went
blind. He died in 1408.</p>

<p>Chaucer, whose eyes saw England in her greatness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
after the Battle of Crecy in 1346, and in her
pitiful state at the downfall of Richard II., saw
such a pageant of clothes pass before him that,
in describing those wonderful national types,
his Canterbury Pilgrims, he marks each one with
some hint of array that we may know what
manner of habit was proper to
them. Here, then, is a list of
the clothes he pictured them as
wearing:</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 118px;">
<img src="images/ecill076.png" width="118" height="250"
alt="The knight" />
</div>

<p class="smcap">The Knight</p>

<p>wears a fustian doublet, all rust-stained
by his coat of mail. It is
interesting to note
how old-fashioned is
the character of this
&lsquo;verray parfit gentil knight,&rsquo; for he
belongs more rightly to the chivalrous
time of the first half of
Edward III.&rsquo;s reign rather than to
the less gentle time of Richard.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 104px;">
<img src="images/ecill077.png" width="104" height="250"
alt="The squire" />
</div>

<p class="smcap">The Squire.</p>

<p>His locks were curled, &lsquo;as they
were leyed in presse.&rsquo; His short gown with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
wide sleeves was covered with embroidery of red and
white flowers.</p>

<p class="smcap">The Yeoman</p>

<p>is in a coat and hood of green. He has a sheaf of
peacock arrows in his belt; across his shoulder is a
green baldrick to carry a horn. There is a figure of
St. Christopher in silver hanging on his breast.</p>

<p class="smcap">The Prioress</p>

<p>is in a handsome cloak; she wears coral beads
gauded with green, and a brooch of gold&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;On which was first write a-crowned A,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after, &ldquo;Amor vincit omnia.&rdquo;&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="smcap">The Monk</p>

<p>wears his gown, but has his sleeves trimmed with
gray squirrel. To fasten his hood he has a curious
gold pin, wrought at the greater end with a love-knot.</p>

<p class="smcap">The Friar</p>

<p>has his cape stuck full of knives and pins &lsquo;for to
yeven faire wyves.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="smcap">The Merchant</p>

<p>is in a motley of colours&mdash;parti-coloured. His
beard is forked; upon his head is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
Flaunderish beaver hat. His boots are elegantly
clasped.</p>

<p class="smcap">The Clerk</p>

<p>wears a threadbare tunic.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 79px;">
<img src="images/ecill078.png" width="79" height="250"
alt="The man of law" />
</div>

<p class="smcap">The Man of Law</p>

<p>is in a coat of parti-colours, his belt of
silk with small metal bars on it.</p>

<p class="smcap">The Frankeleyn or Country
Gentleman</p>

<p>has a white silk purse and a two-edged
dagger, or akelace, at his girdle.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then come the <span class="smcap">Haberdasher</span>, the <span class="smcap">Carpenter</span>,
the <span class="smcap">Weaver</span>, the <span class="smcap">Dyer</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Tapestry
Worker</span>, all in the livery of their companies.
They all carry pouches, girdles, and knives,
mounted in silver.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="smcap">The Shipman</p>

<p>is in a gown of falding (a coarse cloth), reaching to
his knees. A dagger is under his arm, on a lace
hanging round his neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span></p>

<p class="smcap">The Doctor</p>

<p>wears a gown of red and blue (pers was a blue
cloth) lined with taffeta and sendal.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 152px;">
<img src="images/ecill079.png" width="152" height="250"

<p class="smcap">The Wife of Bath.</p>

<p>Her wimples of fine linen&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">&lsquo;I dorste swere they weyeden ten pound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That on a Sonday were upon hir heed.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Her hose was of fine scarlet red; her shoes were
moist and new. Her hat
was as broad as a buckler,
and she wore a foot-mantle
about her hips.</p>

<p class="smcap">The Ploughman</p>

<p>wears a tabard, a loose
smock without sleeves.</p>

<p class="smcap">The Reve or Steward</p>

<p>wears a long surcoat of blue
cloth (pers).</p>

<p class="smcap">The Somnour</p>

<p>(an officer who summoned persons before the ecclesiastical
courts) wears on his head a garland&mdash;&lsquo;as
greet as it were for an ale-stake.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 75px;">
<img src="images/ecill080.png" width="75" height="250"
alt="The pardoner" />
</div>

<p class="smcap">The Pardoner</p>

<p>has long yellow hair falling about his
shoulders; his hood is turned back, and
he wears a tall cap, on which is sewn
a Vernicle. This is the handkerchief
of St. Veronica on which there was
an impression of our Lord&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>This completes the list of Pilgrims,
but it will be useful to give a few
more descriptions of dress as described
by Chaucer. The Carpenter&rsquo;s wife in
the Miller&rsquo;s Tale is described:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Fair was this yonge wyf, and ther-with-al<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As broad as is the bos of a buckler.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her shoes were laced on hir legges hye.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here also, from the Parson&rsquo;s Tale, is a sermon
against the vain clothing of his time, that will
serve to show how you may best paint this age,
and to what excess of imagination you may run.
I have reduced the wording into more modern
English:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;As to the first sin, that is in superfluitee of
clothing, which that maketh it so dere, to the
harm of the people; not only the cost of embroidering,
the elaborate endenting or barring, ornamenting
with waved lines, paling, winding, or
bending, and semblable waste of cloth in vanity;
but there is also costly furring in their gowns, so
muche pounching of chisels to make holes, so
much dagging of shears; forthwith the superfluity
in the length of the foresaid gowns, trailing in
the dung and the mire, on horse and eek on foot,
as well of man as of woman, that all this trailing
is verily as in effect wasted, consumed, threadbare,
and rotten with dung, rather than it is given to the
poor; to great damage of the aforesaid poor folk.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Upon the other side, to speak of the horrible
disordinate scantiness of clothing, as be this cutted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
sloppes or hainselins (short jackets), that through
their shortness do not cover the shameful members
of man, to wicked intent.&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>After this, the good Parson, rising to a magnificent
torrent of wrathful words, makes use of
such homely expressions that should move the
hearts of his hearers&mdash;words which, in our day, are
not seemly to our artificial and refined palates.</p>

<p>Further, Chaucer remarks upon the devices of
love-knots upon clothes, which he calls &lsquo;amorettes&rsquo;;
on trimmed clothes, as being &lsquo;apyked&rsquo;; on nearly
all the fads and fashions of his time.</p>

<p>It is to Chaucer, and such pictures as he
presents, that our minds turn when we think
vaguely of the Middle Ages, and it is worth our
careful study, if we wish to appreciate the times to
the full, to read, no matter the hard spelling, the
&lsquo;Vision of Piers the Plowman,&rsquo; by Langland.</p>

<p>I have drawn a few of the Pilgrims, in order to
show that they may be reconstructed by reading
the chapters on the fourteenth century.</p>

<h2>HENRY THE FOURTH</h2>

<p class="smlfont center">Reigned fourteen years: 1399-1413.</p>

<p class="smlfont center">Born 1366. Married, 1380, Mary de Bohun;
1403, Joan of Navarre.</p>


<h3>THE MEN AND WOMEN</h3>

<p>The reign opens sombrely enough&mdash;Richard in
prison, and twenty-five suits of cloth of gold left,
among other of his butterfly raiment, in Haverford
Castle.</p>

<p>We are still in the age of the houppelande,
the time of cut edges, jagging, big sleeves and
trailing gowns. Our fine gentlemen take the air
in the long loose gown, or the short edition of
the same with the skirts cut from it. They have
invented, or the tailor has invented, or necessity
has contrived, a new sleeve. It is a bag sleeve,
very full and fine, enormous at the elbow, tight
at the wrist, where it may fall over the hand in
a wide cuff with dagged edges, or it may end in
a plain band.</p>

<p class="caption">A MAN AND WOMAN OF THE TIME OF
HENRY IV. (1399-1413)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">Very little change in dress; the man in the loose
gown called the houppelande. The woman also in a
houppelande.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
Let us take six gentlemen met together to
learn the old thirteenth-century part-song, the
round entitled &lsquo;Sumer is icumen in.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 353px;">
<img src="images/ecill081.png" width="353" height="250"
alt="Two men of the time of Henry IV." />
</div>

<p>The first, maybe, is in the high-collared houppelande
with the long skirts; his sleeves are of a
different colour to his gown, and are fastened to it
under cut epaulettes at his shoulders; he wears
a baldrick, hung with bells, over his shoulder;
his houppelande is split on one side to show his
parti-coloured hose beyond his knee; his shoes
are long and very pointed; his hair is cut short,
and he wears a twisted roll of stuff round his
head.</p>

<p>The second is in the latest mode; he wears the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
voluminous sleeves which end
in a plain band at his wrist, and
these sleeves are of a different
colour to his houppelande, the
skirts of which are cut short at
the knee, and then are cut into
neat dags. This garment is not
so full as that of the first gentleman,
which is gathered in at the
waist by a long-tongued belt,
but is buttoned down the front
to the waist and is full in the skirt; also it has no
collar. This man wears his hair long and curled
at the nape of his neck.</p>

<p>A third of these gentlemen, a big
burly man, is in a very short tunic
with wide sleeves; his tights are of
two colours, his left leg red, his right
blue. Over his tunic he wears a
quilted waistcoat, the collar and
armholes of which are trimmed with
fur.</p>

<p>A fourth wears a loose houppelande, one
half of which is blue and the other half
black; it is buttoned from throat to foot; the

sleeves are wide.
His hair is long, and
his beard is brushed
into two points.</p>

<p>The fifth gentleman
wears a houppelande
of middle
length, with a very
high collar buttoned
up the neck, the two
top buttons being
undone; the top of the collar rolls over. He
has the epaulette, but instead of showing the very
full bag sleeves he shows a little loose
sleeve to the elbow, and a tight sleeve
from the elbow to the hand, where it
forms a cuff. He wears a very new-fashioned
cap like a stiff sugar-bag,
with the top lopping over.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 115px;">
<img src="images/ecill086.png" width="115" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Henry IV." />
</div>

<p>The sixth and last of this group
is wearing an unbound houppelande&mdash;that
is, he wears no belt. He
wears a plain hood which is over his head, and
a soft, loose, peaked hat.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sumer is icumen in,&rsquo; the six sing out, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
shepherd, who can hear them from outside, is
considering whether he can play the air upon his
pipe. He is dressed in a loose tunic, a hood,
and a wide-brimmed straw hat; his pipe is stuck
in his belt.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that the wives of the six gentlemen
are seated listening to the manly voices of
their lords.</p>

<p>The first wears a dress of blue, which is laced
from the opening to the waist, where the laces
are tied in a neat bow and hang
down. Her dress is cut fairly low;
it has tight sleeves which come over
her hands to the knuckles in tight
cuffs. There is a wide border, about
a foot and a half, of ermine on the
skirt of her dress. She wears a
mantle over her shoulders. Her hair
is enclosed in a stiff square caul of
gold wire over cloth of gold.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 118px;">
<img src="images/ecill087.png" width="118" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of Henry IV." />
</div>

<p>The second lady is wearing a houppelande with
wide, hanging sleeves all cut at the edge; the cut
of this gown is loose, except that it fits across her
shoulders; she also wears a caul, from the back of
which emerges a linen wimple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
The third lady is in surcoat and cotehardie; the
surcoat has a pleated skirt, and the borders of it
are edged thickly with fur; it is cut low enough at
the sides to show a belt over the hips. The cotehardie,
of a different colour to the surcoat, has
tight sleeves with buttons from elbow to little
finger. This lady has her hair cut short at the
nape of her neck, and bound about the brows with
a golden circlet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 512px;">
<img src="images/ecill088.png" width="512" height="250"
alt="Three women of the time of Henry IV." />
</div>

<p>A fourth wears a very loose houppelande, encircled
about the waist with a broad belt, the
tongue of which hangs down and has an ornamented
end. This houppelande falls in great folds from the
neck to the feet, and is gathered into the neck; it
has loose, but not wide, sleeves, falling just below
the elbow. The gown is worn over a cotehardie,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
the sleeves of which show through the other
sleeves, and the skirt of which shows when the
gown skirt is gathered up.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 186px;">
<img src="images/ecill089.png" width="186" height="250"
alt="Two women of the time of Henry IV." />
</div>

<p>The fifth lady also wears a cotehardie with a
skirt to it; she wears over it a circular mantle,
buttoned by three buttons on the right shoulder,
and split from there to the edge on both sides,
showing the dress; the front semicircle of the cloak
is held to the waist by a belt so that the back
hangs loose. Her hair is in a caul.</p>

<p>The sixth is in a very plain dress, tight-fitting,
buttoned in front, with full skirts. She wears a
white linen hood which shows the
shape of the caul in which her hair
is imprisoned.</p>

<p>So is this queer old round sung,
&lsquo;Sumer is icumen in.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Afterwards, perhaps one of these
ladies, wishing to get some spite
against one of the gentlemen, will ride away in
a heavy riding-cloak, the hood over her head
and a peaked hat on that, and she will call upon
a witch. The witch will answer the rapping at
her humble door, and will come out, dressed in
a country dress&mdash;just an ill-fitting gown and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
hood, with some attempt at classical ornament
on the gown, or a cloak sewn with the sacred
initials thrown over her back. These two will
bargain awhile for the price of a leaden image to
be made in the likeness of the ill-fated gentleman,
or, rather, a rough figure, on which his name will be
scratched; then the puppet will be cast into the
fire and melted while certain evil charms are
spoken, and the malicious accident required to
befall him will be spoken aloud for the Devil&rsquo;s
private ear. Possibly some woman sought a witch
near Evesham in the year 1410, and bought
certain intentions against a tailor of that place,
Badby by name; for this much is certain: that
the tailor was burnt for Lollardy ten years after
the first victim for Lollard heresy, William
Sawtre.</p>

<h3>THE MEN</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 134px;">
<img src="images/ecill090.png" width="134" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Henry V." />
</div>

<p>I think I may call this a transitional
period of clothes, for it
contains the ragged ends of the
time of Richard II. and the old
clothes of the time of Henry IV.,
and it contains the germs of a
definite fashion, a marked change
which came out of the chrysalis
stage, and showed itself in the
prosperous butterflies of the
sixth Henry&rsquo;s time.</p>

<p>We retain the houppelande, its curtailments, its
exaggerations, its high and low collar, its plain or
jagged sleeves. We retain the long hair, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
&lsquo;busheth pleasauntlie,&rsquo; and the short hair of the
previous reign. Also we see the new ideas for the
priest-cropped hair and the roundlet hat.</p>

<p>I speak of the men only.</p>

<p>It was as if, in the press of French affairs, man
had but time to ransack his grandfather&rsquo;s and his
father&rsquo;s chests, and from thence to pull out a
garment or two at a venture. If the garment was
a little worn in the upper part of the sleeve, he
had a slash made there, and embroidered it round.
If the baldrick hung with bells was worn out in
parts, he cut those pieces away and turned the
baldrick into a belt. If the skirts of the houppelande
were sadly frayed at the edge, enter Scissors
again to cut them off short; perhaps the sleeves
were good&mdash;well, leave them on; perhaps the
skirts were good and the sleeves soiled&mdash;well, cut
out the sleeves and pop in some of his father&rsquo;s bag
sleeves. Mind you, my honest gentleman had
trouble brewing: no sooner had he left the wars in
Normandy and Guienne than the siege of Harfleur
loomed to his vision, and after that Agincourt&mdash;Agincourt,
where unarmoured men prevailed over
mailed knights at the odds of six to one; Agincourt,
where archers beat the great knights of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
France on open ground! Hear them hammer on
the French armour with their steel mallets, while
the Frenchmen, weighed down with their armour,
sank knee-deep in the mud&mdash;where we lost 100 men,
against the French loss of 10,000!</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 142px;">
<img src="images/ecill091.png" width="142" height="250" alt="" />
<span class="caption">A Belt with Bells.</span>
</div>

<p>See the port of Le Havre, with the English
army landed there&mdash;Henry in his full-sleeved
gown, his hair cropped close and
shaven round his head from his
neck to an inch above his ears,
buskins on his feet, for he wore
buskins in preference to long
boots or pointed shoes. The
ships in the harbour are painted
in gay colours&mdash;red, blue, in
stripes, in squares; the sails are
sewn with armorial bearings or
some device. Some of our
gentlemen are wearing open
houppelandes over their armour; some wear the
stuffed turban on their heads, with a jewelled
brooch stuck in it; some wear the sugar-bag cap,
which falls to one side; some are hooded, others
wear peaked hats. One hears, &lsquo;By halidom!&rsquo; I
wonder if all the many, many people who have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
hastily written historical novels of this age, and
have peppered them with &lsquo;By halidoms,&rsquo; knew
that &lsquo;By halidom&rsquo; means &lsquo;By the relics of the
saints,&rsquo; and that an &lsquo;harlote&rsquo; means a man who
was a buffoon who told ribald stories?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 155px;">
<img src="images/ecill092.png" width="155" height="250" alt="" />
<span class="caption">The Turban.</span>
</div>

<p>Still, among all these gentlemen, clothed, as it
were, second-hand, we have the fine fellow, the
dandy&mdash;he to whom dress is
a religion, to whom stuffs are
sonnets, cuts are lyrical, and
tailors are the poets of their
age. Such a man will have his
tunic neatly pleated, rejecting
the chance folds of the easy-fitting
houppelande, the folds
of which were determined by
the buckling of the belt. His
folds will be regular and precise,
his collar will be very
stiff, with a rolled top; his
hose will be of two colours, one to each leg, or
parti-coloured. His shoes will match his hose,
and be of two colours; his turban hat will be
cocked at a jaunty angle; his sleeves will be of
a monstrous length and width. He will hang a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
chain about his neck, and load his fingers with
rings. A fellow to him, one of his own kidney,
will wear the skirt of his tunic a little longer,
and will cause it to be cut up the middle; his
sleeves will not be pendant, like drooping wings,
but will be swollen like full-blown bagpipes.
An inner sleeve, very finely embroidered, will
peep under the upper cuff. His collar is done
away with, but he wears a little hood with cut
edges about his neck; his hair is cropped in the
new manner, like a priest&rsquo;s without a tonsure; his
hat is of the queer sugar-bag shape, and it flops in
a drowsy elegance over the stuffed brim. As for
his shoes, they are two fingers long beyond his
toes.</p>

<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY V. (1413-1422)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">Notice the bag cap with a jewel stuck in it.</p>

<p>We shall see the fashions of the two past reigns
hopelessly garbled, cobbled, and stitched together;
a sleeve from one, a skirt from another. Men-at-arms
in short tunics of leather and quilted waistcoats
to wear under their half-armour; beggars
in fashions dating from the eleventh century; a
great mass of people in undistinguishable attire,
looking mostly like voluminous cloaks on spindle
legs, or mere bundles of drapery; here and there a
sober gentleman in a houppelande of the simplest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
kind, with wide skirts reaching to his feet, and the
belt with the long tongue about his middle.</p>

<p>The patterns upon the dresses of these people
are heraldry contortions&mdash;heraldic beasts intertwined
in screws and twists of conventional foliage,
griffins and black dogs held by floral chains to
architectural branches, martlets and salamanders
struggling in grotesque bushes, or very elaborate
geometrical patterned stuffs.</p>

<p>There is a picture of the Middle Ages which
was written by Langland in &lsquo;Piers the Plowman&rsquo;&mdash;a
picture of an alehouse, where Peronelle of
Flanders and Clarice of Cockeslane sit with the
hangman of Tyburn and a dozen others. It is a
picture of the fourteenth century, but it holds
good until the time of Henry VIII., when Skelton,
his tutor, describes just such another tavern on the
highroad, where some bring wedding-rings to pay
their scot of ale, and</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Some bryngeth her husband&rsquo;s hood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because the ale is good.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Both accounts are gems of description, both
full of that rich, happy, Gothic flavour, that sense
of impressionist portraiture, of broad humour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
which distinguishes the drawings in the Loutrell
Psalter.</p>

<p>I feel now as if I might be accused of being
interesting and of overlaying my history with too
much side comment, and I am well aware that
convention demands that such books as this shall
be as dull as possible; then shall the
vulgar rejoice, because they have been
trained to believe that dullness and
knowledge snore in each other&rsquo;s
arms.</p>

<p>However wholeheartedly you may
set about writing a list of clothes
attributable to certain dates, there
will crop up spirits of the age, who
blur the edges of the dates, and
give a lifelike semblance to them
which carries the facts into the
sphere of fiction, and fiction was
ever on the side of truth. No story
has ever been invented by man but it has been
beaten out of time by Nature and the police-courts;
no romance has been penned so intricate
but fact will supply a more surprising twist to
life. But, whereas facts are of necessity bald
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
and naked things, fiction, which is the wardrobe
of fact, will clothe truth in more accustomed
guise.</p>

<p>I put before you some true facts of the clothes
of this time, clothed in a little coat of facts put
fictionally. I write the word &lsquo;cloak&rsquo;; describe
to you that such people wore circular cloaks split
at one or both sides, on one side to the neck,
on the other below the shoulder; of semicircular
cloaks, of square cloaks, of oblong cloaks, all of
which were worn (I speak of these, and you may
cut them out with some thought); but I wish to
do more than that&mdash;I wish to give you a gleam of
the spirit in which the cloaks were worn. A cloak
will partake of the very soul and conscience of its
owner; become draggle-tailed, flaunting, effeminate,
masterful, pompous, or dignified. Trousers, I
think, of all the garments of men, fail most to
show the state of his soul; they merely proclaim
the qualities of his purse. Cloaks give most the
true man, and after that there is much in the cock
of a hat and the conduct of a cane.</p>

<p>In later days one might tell what manner of
man had called to find you away if he chanced to
leave his snuff-box behind. This reasoning is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
finicky, but very profound; accept it in the right
spirit.</p>

<p>Now, one more picture of the age.</p>

<p>The rich man at home, dressed, as I say, in his
father&rsquo;s finery, with some vague additions of his
own, has acquired a sense of luxury. He prefers
to dine alone, in a room with a chimney and a fire
in it. He can see through a window in the wall
by his side into the hall, where his more patriarchal
forebears loved to take their meals. The soiled
rushes are being swept away, and fresh herbs and
rushes strewn in their place; on these mattresses
will in their turn be placed, on which his household
presently will lay them down to sleep.</p>


<h3>THE WOMEN</h3>

<p>Every time I write the heading &lsquo;The Women&rsquo;
to such chapters as these, I feel that such threadbare
cloak of chivalry as I may pin about my
shoulders is in danger of slipping off.</p>

<p>Should I write &lsquo;The Ladies&rsquo;? But although
all ladies are women, not all women are ladies, and
as it is far finer to be a sweet woman than a great
dame, I will adhere to my original heading, &lsquo;The
Women.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
However, in the remote ages of which I now
write, the ladies were dressed and the women wore
clothes, which is a subtle distinction. I dare not
bring my reasoning up to the present day.</p>

<p>As I said in my last chapter, this was an age of
medley&mdash;of this and that wardrobe flung open,
and old fashions renovated or carried on. Fashion,
that elusive goddess, changes her moods and modes
with such a quiet swiftness that she leaves us
breathless and far behind, with a bundle of silks
and velvets in our arms.</p>

<p>How is a fashion born? Who mothers it?
Who nurses it to fame, and in whose arms does
it die? High collar, low collar, short hair, long
hair, boot, buskin, shoe&mdash;who wore you first?
Who last condemned you to the World&rsquo;s Great
Rag Market of Forgotten Fads?</p>

<p>Now this, I have said, was a transitional age,
but I cannot begin to say who was the first great
dame to crown her head with horns, and who the
last to forsake the jewelled caul. It is only on
rare occasions that the decisive step can be traced
to any one person or group of persons: Charles II.
and his frock-coat, Brummell and his starched stock,
are finger-posts on Fashion&rsquo;s highroad, but they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
are not quite true guides. Charles was recommended
to the coat, and I think the mist of soap
and warm water that enshrines Brummell as the
Apostle of Cleanliness blurs also the mirror of
truth. It does not much matter.</p>

<p>No doubt&mdash;and here there will be readers the
first to correct me and the last to see my point&mdash;there
are persons living full of curious knowledge
who, diving yet more deeply into the dusty
crevices of history, could point a finger at the
man who first cut his hair in the early fifteenth-century
manner, and could write you the name
and the dignities of the lady who first crowned her
fair head with horns.</p>

<p>For myself, I begin with certainty at Adam and
the fig-leaf, and after that I plunge into the world&rsquo;s
wardrobe in hopes.</p>

<p>Certain it is that in this reign the close caul
grew out of all decent proportions, and swelled
into every form of excrescence and protuberance,
until in the reign of Henry VI. it towered above
the heads of the ladies, and dwarfed the stature
of the men.</p>

<p>This curious head-gear, the caul, after a modest
appearance, as a mere close, gold-work cap, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
time of Edward III., grew into a stiffer affair
in the time of Richard II., but still was little more
than a stiff sponge-bag of gold wire and stuff and
a little padding; grew still more in the time of
Henry IV., and took squarer shapes and stiffer
padding; and in the reign of Henry V. it became
like a great orange, with a hole cut in it for the
face&mdash;an orange which covered the ears, was cut
straight across the forehead, and bound all round
with a stiff jewelled band.</p>

<p>Then came the idea of the horn. Whether some
superstitious lady thought that the wearing of
horns would keep away the evil eye, or whether
it was a mere frivol of some vain Duchess, I do not
know.</p>

<p>As this fashion came most vividly into prominence
in the following reign, I shall leave a more
detailed description of it until that time, letting
myself give but a short notice of its more simple
forms.</p>

<p>We see the caul grow from its circular shape
into two box forms on either side of the head;
the uppermost points of the boxes are arranged in
horns, whose points are of any length from 4 to
14 inches. The top of this head-dress is covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
with a wimple, which is sometimes stiffened with
wires.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 342px;">

<img src="images/ecpl28.jpg" width="342" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY V. (1413-1422)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">Her surcoat is stiffened in front with fur and shaped
with a band of metal. Her belt is low on the hips
of the under-dress. The horns on her head carry the
large linen wimple.</p>

<p>There is also a shape something like a fez or a
flower-pot, over which a heavy wimple is hung,
attached to this shape; outside the wimple are two
horns of silk, linen, or stuff&mdash;that is, silk bags
stuffed to the likeness of horns.</p>

<p>I should say that a true picture of this time
would give but few of these very elaborate horn
head-dresses, and the mass of women would be
wearing the round caul.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 112px;">
<img src="images/ecill095.png" width="112" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of Henry V." />
</div>

<p>The surcoat over the cotehardie is the general
wear, but it has more fit about it than formerly;
the form of the waist and bust are
accentuated by means of a band of
heavy gold embroidery, shaped to the
figure. The edges of the surcoat are
furred somewhat heavily, and the skirt
often has a deep border of fur. Sometimes
a band of metal ornament runs
across the top of the breast and down
the centre of the surcoat, coming below the fur
edging. The belt over the hips of the cotehardie
holds the purse, and often a ballade or a rondel.</p>

<p>You will see a few of the old houppelandes, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
their varieties of sleeve, and in particular that long,
loose double sleeve, or, rather, the very long under-sleeve,
falling over the hand. This under-sleeve is
part of the houppelande.</p>

<p>All the dresses have trains, very full trains,
which sweep the ground, and those readers who
wish to make such garments must remember to be
very generous over the material.</p>

<p>The women commonly wear the semicircular
mantle, which they fasten across them by cords
running through ornamental brooches.</p>

<p>They wear very rich metal and enamel belts
round their hips, the exact ornamentation of which
cannot be described here; but it was the ornament
of the age, which can easily be discovered.</p>

<p>In the country, of course, simpler garments
prevail, and plain surcoats and cotehardies are
wrapped in cloaks and mantles of homespun
material. The hood has not fallen out of use
for women, and the peaked hat surmounts it for
riding or rough weather. Ladies wear wooden
clogs or sandals besides their shoes, and they have
not yet taken to the horns upon their heads; some
few of them, the great dames of the counties
whose lords have been to London on King&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
business, or returned from France with new ideas, have
donned the elaborate business of head-boxes and
wires and great wimples.</p>

<p>As one of the ladies rides in the country lanes,
she may pass that Augustine convent where
Dame Petronilla is spiritual Mother to so many,
and may see her in Agincourt year keeping her
pig-tally with Nicholas Swon, the swineherd.
They may see some of the labourers she hires
dressed in the blood-red cloth she has given them,
for the dyeing of which she paid 7s. 8d. for 27 ells.
The good dame&rsquo;s nuns are very neat; they have an
allowance of 6s. 8d. a year for dress.</p>

<p>This is in 1415. No doubt next year my lady,
riding through the lanes, will meet some sturdy
beggar, who will whine for alms, pleading that he
is an old soldier lately from the field of Agincourt.</p>

<p>What a reign! Was
history ever better dressed?</p>

<p>I never waver between
the cardboard figures of the
great Elizabethan time and
this reign as a monument to
lavish display, but if any
time should beat this for
quaintness, colour, and
variety, it is the time of
Henry VIII.</p>

<p>Look at the scenes and
characters to be dressed: John, Duke of Bedford,
the Protector, Joan of Arc, Jack Cade, a hundred
other people; Crevant, Verneuil, Orleans, London
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
Bridge, Ludlow, St. Albans, and a hundred other
historical backgrounds.</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of all this, in spite of the fact that
Joan of Arc is one of the world&rsquo;s personalities, it is
difficult to pick our people out of the tapestries.</p>

<p>Now, you may have noticed that in trying to
recreate a period in your mind certain things immediately
swing into your vision: it is difficult to
think of the Conquest without the Bayeux tapestry;
it is difficult to think of the dawn of the sixteenth
century without the dreamy, romantic landscapes
which back the figures of Giorgione; and it is not
easy to think of these people of the Henry VI.
period without placing them against conventional
tapestry trees, yellow-white castles with red,
pepper-pot roofs, grass luxuriant with
needlework flowers, and all the other
accessories of the art.</p>

</div>

<p>The early times are easily imagined
in rough surroundings or in open air;
knights in armour ride quite comfortably
down modern English lanes.
Alfred may burn his cakes realistically,
and Canute rebuke his courtiers on the beach&mdash;these
one may see in the round. Elizabeth rides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
to Tilbury, Charles II. casts his horoscope, and
George rings the bell, each in their proper atmosphere,
but the Dark Ages are dark, not only in
modes of thought, but in being ages of grotesque,
of ornamentation, of anything but realism.</p>

<p>One has, I think, a conventional mind&rsquo;s eye for
the times from Edward I. to Richard III., from
1272 to 1485, and it is really more easy for a
Chinaman to call up a vision of 604 <small>A.D.</small>, when
Laot-sen, the Chinese philosopher, was born. Laot-sen,
the child-old man, he who was born with white
hair, lived till he was eighty-one, and, having had
five million followers, went up to heaven on a
black buffalo. In China things have changed very
little: the costume is much the same, the customs
are the same, the attitude towards life has not
changed. But here the semicivilized, superstitious,
rather dirty, fourteenth and fifteenth century person
has gone. Scratch a Russian, they say, and you will
see a Tartar; do the same office by an Englishman,
and you may find a hint of the Renaissance under
his skin, but no more. The Middle Ages are dead
and dust.</p>

<p>We will proceed with that congenial paradox
which states that the seat of learning lies in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
head, and so discuss the most distinctive costumery
of this time, the roundlet.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 149px;">
<img src="images/ecill098.png" width="149" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Henry VI.; two types of head-gear" />
</div>

<p>Now, the roundlet is one of those things which
delight the clothes-hunter or the costume expert.
It is the natural result of a
long series of fashions for the
head, and its pedigree is free
from any impediment or hindrance;
it is the great-grandson
of the hood, which is
derived from a fold in a cloak,
which is the beginning of all
things.</p>

<p>I am about to run the risk
of displeasure in repeating to
some extent what I have already written about
the chaperon, the hood, and the other ancestors
and descendants of the roundlet.</p>

<p>A fashion is born, not made. Necessity is the
mother of Art, and Art is the father of Invention.
A man must cover his head, and if he has a cloak,
it is an easy thing in rain or sunshine to pull the
folds of the cloak over his head. An ingenious
fellow in the East has an idea: he takes his 8 feet&mdash;or
more&mdash;of material; he folds it in half, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
at about a foot and a half, or some such convenient
length, he puts several neat and strong stitches
joining one point of the folded material. When
he wraps this garment about him, leaving the
sewn point in the centre of his neck at the back,
he finds that he has directed the folds of his coat
in such a manner as to form a hood, which he may
place on or off his head more conveniently than
the plain unsewn length of stuff. The morning
sun rises on the sands of Sahara and lights upon the
first burnoose. By a simple process in tailoring,
some man, who did not care that the peak of his
hood should be attached to his cloak, cut his cloth
so that the cloak had a hood, the peak of which
was separate and so looser, and yet more easy to
pull on or off. Now comes a man who was taken
by the shape of the hood, but did not require to
wear a cloak, so he cut his cloth in such a way that
he had a hood and shoulder-cape only. From this
to the man who closed the front of the hood from
the neck to the edge of the cape is but a quick
and quiet step. By now necessity was satisfied
and had given birth to art. Man, having admired
his face in the still waters of a pool, seeing how the
oval framed in the hood vastly became him, sought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
to tickle his vanity and win the approbation of the
other sex, so, taking some shears, cut the edge of
his cape in scallops and leaves. A more dandified
fellow, distressed at the success of his brother&rsquo;s
plumage, caused the peak of his hood to be made
long.</p>

<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY VI. (1422-1461)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">His hair is cropped over his ears and has a thick
fringe on his forehead. Upon the ground is his
roundlet, a hat derived from the twisted chaperon of
Richard II.&rsquo;s day. This hat is worn to-day, in
miniature, on the shoulder of the Garter robes.</p>

<p>Need one say more? The long peak grew and
grew into the preposterous liripipe which hung
down the back from the head to the feet. The
dandy spirit of another age, seeing that the liripipe
can grow no more, and that the shape of the hood
is common and not in the true dandiacal spirit,
whips off his hood, and, placing the top of his head
where his face was, he twists the liripipe about
his head, imprisons part of the cape, and, after a
fixing twist, slips the liripipe through part of its
twined self and lets the end hang down on one
side of his face, while the jagged end of the hood
rises or falls like a cockscomb on the other. Cockscomb!
there&rsquo;s food for discussion in that&mdash;fops,
beaux, dandies, coxcombs&mdash;surely.</p>

<p>I shall not go into the matter of the hood with
two peaks, which was not, I take it, a true child
of fashion in the direct line, but a mere cousin&mdash;a
junior branch at that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
As to the dates on this family tree, the vague,
mysterious beginnings <small>B.C.</small>&mdash;goodness knows when&mdash;in
a general way the Fall, the Flood, and the
First Crusade, until the time of the First Edward;
the end of the thirteenth century,
when the liripipe budded, the time
of the Second Edward; the first
third of the fourteenth century,
when the liripipe was in full flower,
the time of the Third Edward; the
middle of the fourteenth century,
when the liripipe as a liripipe was
dying, the time of the Second
Richard; the end of the century, when the
chaperon became the twisted cockscomb turban.
Then, after that, until the twenty-second year of
the fifteenth century, when the roundlet was born&mdash;those
are the dates.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 128px;">
<img src="images/ecill099.png" width="128" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Henry VI." />
</div>

<p>We have arrived by now, quite naturally, at the
roundlet. I left you interested at the last phase
of the hood, the chaperon so called, twisted up
in a fantastical shape on man&rsquo;s head. You must
see that the mere process of tying and retying,
twisting, coiling and arranging, was tedious in
the extreme, especially in stirring times with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
trumpets sounding in England and France. Now
what more likely for the artist of the tied hood
than to puzzle his brains in order to reach a means
by which he could get at the effect without so
much labour! Enter invention&mdash;enter invention
and exit art. With invention, the made-up
chaperon sewn so as to look as if it had been
tied. There was the twist round the head, the
cockscomb, the hanging piece of liripipe. Again
this was to be simplified: the twist made into a
smooth roll, the skull to be covered by an ordinary
cap attached to the roll, the cockscomb converted
into a plain piece of cloth or silk, the liripipe to
become broader. And the end of this, a little
round hat with a heavily-rolled and stuffed brim,
pleated drapery hanging over one side and streamer
of broad stuff over the other; just such a hat did
these people wear, on their heads or slung over
their shoulder, being held in the left hand by means
of the streamer. There the honourable family of
hood came to a green old age, and was, at the end
of the fifteenth century, allowed to retire from
the world of fashion, and was given a pension and
a home, in which home you may still see it&mdash;on
the shoulders of the Garter robe. Also it has two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
more places of honourable distinction&mdash;the roundlet
is on the Garter robe; the chaperon, with the cut
edge, rests as a cockade in the hats of liveried
servants, and the minutest member of the family
remains in the foreign buttons of honourable
Orders.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 189px;">

alt="Six types of head-gear" />
</div>

<p>We have the roundlet, then, for principal head-gear
in this reign, but we must not forget that
the hood is not dead; it is out
of the strict realms of fashion,
but it is now a practical country
garment, or is used for riding
in towns. There are also other
forms of head-wear&mdash;tall, conical
hats with tall brims of fur, some
brims cut or scooped out in
places; again, the hood may
have a furred edge showing
round the face opening; then
we see a cap which fits the
head, has a long, loose back falling over the
neck, and over this is worn a roll or hoop
of twisted stuff. Then there is the sugar-loaf
hat, like a circus clown&rsquo;s, and there is a
broad, flat-brimmed hat with a round top, like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
Noah&rsquo;s hat in the popular representations of the
Ark.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 198px;">
<img src="images/ecill101.png" width="198" height="250"
alt="Two men of the time of Henry VI." />
</div>

<p>Besides these, we have the jester&rsquo;s three-peaked
hood and one-peaked hood, the cape of which
came, divided into points, to
the knees, and had arms with
bell sleeves.</p>

<p>Let us see what manner of
man we have under such hats:
almost without exception
among the gentlemen we have
the priestly hair&mdash;that queer,
shaved, tonsure-like cut, but
without the circular piece cut away
from the crown of the head.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 102px;">
<img src="images/ecill102.png" width="102" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Henry VI." />
</div>

<p>The cut of the tunic in the body
has little variation; it may be longer
or shorter, an inch above or an inch
below the knee, but it is on one main
principle. It is a loose tunic with a
wide neck open in front about a couple
or three inches; the skirt is full, and
may be cut up on one or both sides; it may be
edged with fur or some stuff different to the
body of the garment, or it may be jagged, either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
in regular small scoops or in long fringe-like
jags. The tunic is always belted very low, giving
an odd appearance to the men of this time, as it
made them look very short in the leg.</p>

<p>The great desire for variety is displayed in the
forms of sleeve for this tunic: you may have the
ordinary balloon sleeve ending in a stuff roll or
fur edge for cuff, or you may have a half-sleeve,
very wide indeed, like shoulder-capes, and terminated
in the same manner as the bottom of the
tunics&mdash;that is, fur-edged tunic, fur-edged sleeve,
and so on, as described; under this shows the tight
sleeve of an undergarment, the collar of which
shows above the tunic collar at the neck. The
length of these shoulder-cape sleeves varies according
to the owner&rsquo;s taste, from small epaulettes
to heavy capes below the elbow. There is also a
sleeve tight from wrist to below the elbow, and at
that point very big and wide, tapering gradually
to the shoulder. You will still see one or two
high collars rolled over, and there is a distinct
continuance of the fashion for long-pointed shoes.</p>

<p>There is an almost new form of overcoat which
is really a tunic of the time, unbelted, and with
the sleeves cut out; also one with short, but very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
full, sleeves, the body very loose; and besides the
ordinary forms of square, oblong, and round cloak,
there is a circular cloak split up the right side to
the base of the biceps, with a
round hole in the centre, edged
with fur, for the passage of the
head.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 171px;">
<img src="images/ecill103.png" width="171" height="250"
alt="Two men of the time of Henry VI." />
</div>

<p>Velvet was in common use for
gowns, tunics, and even for bed-clothes,
in the place of blankets.
It was made in all kinds of
beautiful designs, diapered, and raised over a
ground of gold or silk, or double-piled, one pile
on another of the same colour making the pattern
known by the relief.</p>

<p>The massed effect of well-dressed crowds must
have been fine and rich in colour&mdash;here and there
a very rich lady or a magnificent gentleman in
pall (the beautiful gold or crimson web, known
also as bandekin), the velvets, the silks of marvellous
colours, and none too fresh or new. I think that
such a gathering differed most strongly from a
gathering of to-day by the fact that one is impressed
to-day with the new, almost tinny newness, of the
people&rsquo;s clothes, and that these other people were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
not so extravagant in the number of their dresses
as in the quality, so that then one would have seen
many old and beautifully-faded velvets and sun-licked
silks and rain-improved cloths.</p>

<p>Among all this crowd would pass, in a plain
tunic and short shoes, Henry, the ascetic King.</p>


<h3>THE WOMEN</h3>

</div>

<p>One is almost disappointed
to find nothing upon the
curious subject of horns in
&lsquo;Sartor Resartus.&rsquo; Such a
flaunting, Jovian spirit, and
poetry of abuse as might
have been expected from the
illustrious and iconoclastic
author would have suited me, at this present date,
most admirably.</p>

<p>I feel the need of a few thundering German
words, or a brass band at the end of my pen, or
purple ink in my inkwell, or some fantastic and
wholly arresting piece of sensationalism by which
to convey to you that you have now stepped into
the same world as the Duchess out of &lsquo;Alice in
Wonderland.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 110px;">
<img src="images/ecill105.png" width="110" height="150"
alt="A head-dress for a woman" />
</div>

<p>Look out of your window and see upon the
flower-enamelled turf a hundred bundles of vanity
taking the air. The heads of these
ladies are carried very erect, as are all
heads bearing weights. The waists
of these ladies are apparently under
their bosoms; their feet seem to be
an ell long. An assembly hour is,
after the manner of Lydgate&rsquo;s poem, a dream of
delicious faces surmounted by minarets, towers,
horns, excrescences of every shape&mdash;enormous,
fat, heart-shaped erections,
covered with rich, falling drapery, or
snow-white linen, or gold tissue; gold-wire
boxes sewn with pearls and
blazing with colours; round, flat-topped
caps, from under which girls&rsquo; hair
escapes in a river of colour; crown
shapes, circular shapes, mitre shapes,
turbans, and shovel-shaped linen erections,
wired into place.</p>

<p>Oh, my lady, my lady! how did you
ever hear the soft speeches of gallantry? How
did the gentle whispers of love ever penetrate
those bosses of millinery?</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 86px;">
<img src="images/ecill106.png" width="86" height="300"

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
And the moralists, among whom Heaven forbid
that I should be found, painted lurid pictures for
you of hell and purgatory, in which such head-dresses
turned into instruments of torture; you
lifted your long-fingered, medieval hand and shook
the finger with the toad-stone upon it, as if to
dispel the poison of their words.</p>

<p>I think it is beyond me to describe in understandable
terms the proper contortions of your
towered heads, for I have little use for archaic
words, for crespine, henk, and jacque, for herygouds
with honginde sleeves, for all the blank cartridges
of antiquarianism. I cannot convey the triple-curved
crown, the ear buttress, the magnet-shaped
roll in adequate language, but I can
draw them for you.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 136px;">
<img src="images/ecill107.png" width="136" height="250"
alt="Two women of the time of Henry VI." />
</div>

<p>I will attempt the most popular
of the roll head-dresses and the simpler
of the stiff-wired box. Take a roll,
stuffed with hemp or tow, of some
rich material and twist it into the
form of a heart in front and a <img src="images/v.png" width="13" height="15" alt="V" /> shape behind,
where join the ends, or, better, make a circle or
hoop of your rolled stuff and bend it in this way.
Then make a cap that will fit the head and come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
over the ears, and make it so that this cap shall join
the heart-shaped roll at all points and cause it to
appear without any open spaces between the head
and the roll; the point of the heart in front will be
round, and will come over the centre of the face.
By joining cap and roll you will have one complete
affair; over this you may brooch a linen wimple
or a fine piece of jagged silk. In fact, you may
twist your circle of stuff in any manner, providing
you keep a vague <img src="images/u.png" width="12" height="15" alt="U" /> shape in front and completely
cover the hair behind.</p>

<p>For the box pattern it is necessary to make a
box, let us say of octagonal shape, flat before and
behind, or slightly curved; cut away the side under
the face, or leave but a thin strip of it to go under
the chin. Now stuff your box on either side of the
face and cut away the central square, except for
3 inches at the top, on the forehead; here, in
this cut-away piece, the face shows. You will
have made your box of buckram and stuffed the
wings of it with tow; now you must fit your box
to a head and sew linen between the sides of the
head and the tow to hold it firm and make it good
to wear. You have now finished the rough shape,
and you must ornament it. Take a piece of thin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
gold web and cover your box, then get some gold
braid and make a diaper or criss-cross pattern all
over the box, leaving fair sized lozenges; in these
put, at regular intervals as a plain check, small
squares of crimson silk so that they fit across the
lozenge and so make a double pattern. Now take
some gold wire or brass wire and knot it at neat
intervals, and then stitch it on to the edges of the
gold braid, after which pearl beads may be arranged
on the crimson squares and at the cross of the
braid; then you will have your box-patterned head-dress
complete.</p>

<p>It remains for you to enlarge upon this, if you
wish, in the following manner: take a stiff piece
of wire and curve it into the segment of a circle,
so that you may bend the horns as much or as
little as you will, fasten the centre of this to the
band across the forehead, or on to the side-boxes,
and over it place a large wimple with the front
edge cut. Again, for further enhancement of
this delectable piece of goods, you may fix a
low gold crown above all&mdash;a crown of an elliptical
shape&mdash;and there you will have as much
magnificence as ever graced lady of the fifteenth
century.</p>

her husband in London</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;I would ye were at home, if it were your ease,

it is where ye be now, liefer than a gown though
it were of scarlet.&rsquo;</p>

<p>My dear diplomatist, I have forgotten if you
got both your husband and the gown, or the gown
only, but it was a sweetly pretty
letter, and worded in such a way
as must have caused your good
knight to smile, despite his sore.
And what had you in your mind&rsquo;s
eye when you wrote &lsquo;liefer than a
gown though it were of scarlet&rsquo;?
It was one of those new gowns
with the high waist and the bodice opening very
low, the collar quite over your shoulders, and the
thick fur edge on your shoulders and tapering
into a point at your bosom. You wanted sleeves
like wings, and a fur edge to the bottom of
the gown, besides the fur upon the edges of the
sleeves&mdash;those quaint sleeves, thin to your elbows,
and then great and wide, like a foresail. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
suppose you had an under-gown of some wonderful
diapered silk which you thought would go well
with scarlet, because, as you knew, the under-gown
would show at your neck, and its long
train would trail behind you, and its skirt would
fall about your feet and show very bravely when
you bunched up the short upper gown&mdash;all the
mode&mdash;and so you hinted at scarlet.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 75px;">
<img src="images/ecill109.png" width="75" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of Henry VI." />
</div>

<p>Now I come to think of it, the sleeve must have
been hard to arrive at, the fashions were so many.
To have had them tight would have
minimized the use of your undergarment;
to have had them of the
same width from elbow to wrist would
not have given you the newest of the
new ideas to show in Norfolk; then,
for some reason, you rejected the bag
sleeve, which was also in the fashion.</p>

<p>No doubt you had a cotehardie
with well-fitting sleeves and good
full skirts, and a surcoat with a wide
fur edge, or perhaps, in the latest fashion of
these garments, with an entire fur bodice to it.
You may have had also one of those rather ugly
little jackets, very full, with very full sleeves which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
came tight at the wrist, long-waisted, with a little
skirt an inch or so below the belt. A mantle, with
cords to keep it on, I know you had.
Possibly&mdash;I have just thought of it&mdash;the
sleeves of your under-gown, the
tight sleeves, were laced together from
elbow to wrist, in place of the old-fashioned
buttons.</p>

<p>I wonder if you ever saw the great
metal-worker, William Austin, one of
the first among English artists to leave
a great name behind him&mdash;I mean the
Austin who modelled the effigy of
Earl Richard Beauchamp, at Warwick.</p>

<p>You must have heard the leper
use his rattle to warn you of his
proximity. You, too, may have
thought that Joan of Arc was a sorceress
and Friar Bungay a magician.
You may have&mdash;I have not your
wonderful letter here for reference&mdash;heard
all about Eleanor of Cobham,
and how she did penance in a shift

King&rsquo;s person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
Some ladies, I notice, wore the long-tongued
belt&mdash;buckled it in front, and then pushed it
round until the buckle came into the
centre of the back and the tongue
hung down like a tail; but these ladies
were not wearing the high-waisted gown,
but a gown with a normal waist, and with
no train, but a skirt of even fulness and
of the same length all the way round.</p>

</div>

<p>There were striped stuffs, piled velvet, rich-patterned
silks, and homespun cloths and wool to
choose from. Long-peaked shoes, of
course, and wooden clogs out of
doors.</p>

<p>The town and country maids, the
merchants&rsquo; wives, and the poor generally,
each and all according to purse and
pride, dressed in humbler imitation of
the cut of the clothes of the high-born, in quite
simple dresses, with purse, girdle, and apron,
with heads in hoods, or twisted wimples of coarse
linen.</p>

<p>Well, there you lie, ladies, on the tops of
cold tombs, stiff and sedate, your hands uplifted
in prayer, your noses as often as not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
knocked off by later-day schoolboys, crop-headed
Puritans, or Henry VIII.&rsquo;s sacrilegious hirelings.
Lie still in your huge head-dresses and
your neat-folded gowns&mdash;a moral, in marble or
bronze, of the pomps and vanities of this wicked
world.</p>

<h2>EDWARD THE FOURTH</h2>

<p class="smlfont center">Reigned twenty-two years: 1461-1483.</p>

<p class="smlfont center">Born 1441. Married, 1464, Elizabeth Woodville.</p>


<h3>THE MEN</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 114px;">
<img src="images/ecill114.png" width="114" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Edward IV." />
</div>

<p>I invite you to call up this reign
by a picture of Caxton&rsquo;s shop:
you may imagine yourself in the
almonry at Westminster, where,
in a small enclosure by the west
front of the church, there is a
chapel and some almshouses. You
will be able to see the rich come
to look at Mr. Caxton&rsquo;s wares and
the poor slinking in to receive
alms.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;If it please any man, spiritual or temporal, to buy any
pyes of two or three commemorations of Salisbury use emprynted
after the form of this present letter, which be well
and truly correct, let him come to Westminster into the
Almonry at the red pale, and he shall have them good cheap.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>This was Caxton&rsquo;s advertisement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
As you watch the people going and coming
about the small enclosure, you will notice that
the tonsured hair has gone out of fashion, and that
whereas the merchants, citizens, and such people
wear the roundlet hat, the nobles and fine gentlemen
are in black velvet caps, or tall hats with
long-peaked brims, or in round high hats with fur
brim close to the crown of the hat, or in caps with
little rolled brims with a button at the top, over
which two laces pass from back to front, and from
under the brim there falls the last sign, the dying
gasp of the liripipe, now jagged and now with
tasselled ends.</p>

<p>We have arrived at the generally accepted vague
idea of &lsquo;medieval costume,&rsquo; which means really a
hazy notion of the dress of this date: a steeple
head-dress for ladies, a short waist, and a train;
a tall, sugar-loaf hat with a flat top for the men,
long hair, very short and very long tunics, long-pointed
shoes, and wide sleeves&mdash;this, I think, is
the amateur&rsquo;s idea of &lsquo;costume in the Middle Ages.&rsquo;</p>

<p>You will notice that all, or nearly all, the passers-by
Caxton&rsquo;s have long hair; that the dandies have
extra-long hair brushed out in a cloud at the back;
that the older men wear long, very simple gowns,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
which they belt in at the waist with a stuff or
leather belt, on which is hung a bag-purse; that
these plain gowns are laced across the front to the
waist over a vest of some
coloured stuff other than
the gown.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 184px;">
<img src="images/ecill115.png" width="184" height="250"
alt="Two men of the time of Edward IV." />
</div>

<p>You will see that the
poor are in very simple
tunics&mdash;just a loose, stuff
shirt with sleeves about
8 inches wide, and with
the skirts reaching to
the knees, a belt about
their middle&mdash;rough,
shapeless leather shoes, and woollen tights.</p>

<p>You will remember in the early part of the reign,
before the heraldic shield with the red pale, Caxton&rsquo;s
sign, caught your eye, that the fashionable
wore very wide sleeves, great swollen bags fitting
only at shoulder and wrist, and you may recall the
fact that a tailor was fined twenty shillings in 1463
for making such wide sleeves. Poulaines, the very
long shoes, are now forbidden, except that an
esquire and anyone over that rank might wear
them 2 inches beyond the toes; but I think the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
dandies wore the shoes and paid the fine if it were
enforced.</p>

<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF EDWARD IV. (1461-1483)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">Notice the jagged ribbon falling from the brim of
his hat; this is the last of the liripipe.</p>

<p>See Caxton, in a sober-coloured gown, long, and
laced in the front, showing a plain vest under the
lacing, talking to some of his great customers.
The Duchess of Somerset has just lent him
&lsquo;Blanchardine and Eglantine&rsquo;; Earl Rivers, the
Queen&rsquo;s brother, talks over his own translation of
&lsquo;The Sayings of the Philosophers&rsquo;; and Caxton
is extolling that worshipful man Geoffrey Chaucer,
and singing praises in reverence &lsquo;for that noble
poet and great clerke, Vergyl.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Edward himself has been to the shop and has
consented to become patron of an edition of
Tully&mdash;Edward, with his very subtle face, his
tall, handsome appearance, his cold, elegant
manners. He is dressed in a velvet gown edged
with fur; the neck of the gown is low, and the
silk vest shows above it. Across his chest are
gold laces tapering to his waist; these are straight
across the front of his gown-opening. His hair is
straight, and falls to the nape of his neck; he wears
a black velvet cap upon his head. The skirts of
his gown reach to his knees, and are fur-edged; his
sleeves are full at the elbows and tight over his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
wrists; he is wearing red Spanish leather tall
boots, turned over at the top.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 151px;">
<img src="images/ecill116.png" width="151" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Edward IV.; lacing on a cut sleeve" />
</div>

<p>As he stands talking to Caxton, one or two
gentlemen, who have also dismounted, stand about
him. Three of them are in the
height of the fashion. The first
wears a velvet tunic, with fur
edges. The tunic is pleated
before and behind, and is full
and slightly pursed in front;
the sleeves are long, and are
cut from shoulder to wrist,
where they are sewn together
again; cuff and border of the
cut or opening are both edged with fur. The neck
is high, but there is no collar. The length of the
tunic is quite short; it comes well above the knees.
His under-sleeves are full, and are of rich silk;
his shoes are certainly over the allowed length; his
tights are well cut. His peaked hat has gold bands
round the crown.</p>

<p>The second gentleman is also in a very short
tunic, with very wide sleeves; this tunic is pleated
into large even folds, and has a belt of its own
material. His hair is long, and bushed behind;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
his tights are in two colours, and he wears an
eighteen-penny pair of black leather slops or shoes.
His hat is black, tall, but without a peak; a long
feather is brooched into one side of it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 174px;">
<img src="images/ecill117.png" width="174" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Edward IV.; three types of boot" />
</div>

<p>The third man is wearing a low black cap, with
a little close brim; a jagged piece of stuff, about
3 feet long, hangs from under the brim of his hat.
He is wearing long, straight
hair. This man is wearing
a little short tunic, which is
loose at the waist, and comes
but an inch or two below
it; the sleeves are very loose
and wide, and are not fastened
at the wrist; the tunic
has a little collar. The
shortness of his tunic shows
the whole of his tights, and also the ribbon-fastened
cod-piece in front. His shoes are split at
the sides, and come into a peak before and behind.</p>

<p>Now, our gentlemen of this time, having cut
open their baggy sleeves, and made them to hang
down and expose all the under-sleeve, must now
needs lace them up again very loosely. Then, by
way of change, the tight sleeve was split at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
elbow to show a white shirt. Then came the
broad shoulders, when the sleeves were swelled out
at the top to give an air of great breadth
to the shoulders and a more elegant
taper to the waist. Some men had
patterns sewn on one leg of their tights.
The gown, or whatever top garment
was being worn, was sometimes cut into
a low, <img src="images/v.png" width="13" height="15" alt="V" /> shape behind at the neck to
show the undergarment, above which
showed a piece of white shirt.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 96px;">
<img src="images/ecill118.png" width="96" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Edward IV." />
</div>

<p>A long gown, in shape like a monk&rsquo;s habit, wide
sleeves, the same width all the way down, a loose
neck&mdash;a garment indeed to put
on over the head, to slip on for
comfort and warmth&mdash;was quite
a marked fashion in the streets&mdash;as
marked as the little tunic.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 202px;">
<img src="images/ecill119.png" width="202" height="250"
alt="Twelve types of head-gear for men" />
</div>

<p>If you are remembering Caxton&rsquo;s
shop and a crowd of gentlemen,
notice one in a big fur hat,
which comes over his eyes; and see also a man who
has wound a strip of cloth about his neck and
over his head, then, letting one end hang down, has
clapped his round, steeple-crowned hat over it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
You will see high collars, low collars, and
absence of collar, long gown open to the waist,
long gown without opening, short-skirted tunic,
tunic without any skirt, long, short, and medium
shoes, and, at the end of the reign, one or two
broad-toed shoes. Many of these men would be
carrying sticks; most of them would have their
fingers covered with rings.</p>

<p>Among the group of gentlemen about Edward
some merchants have pressed closer to see the
King, and a girl or two has stolen into the front
row. The King, turning to make a laughing
remark to one of his courtiers, will see a roguish,
pretty face behind him&mdash;the face of a merchant&rsquo;s
wife; he will smile at her in a meaning way.</p>


<h3>THE WOMEN</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 201px;">
<img src="images/ecill120.png" width="201" height="200"
alt="A head-dress for a woman" />
</div>

<p>France, at this date, shows
us a sartorial Savonarola, by
name Thomas Conecte, a preaching
friar, who held an Anti-Hennin
Crusade, which ended in
a bonfire of these steeple head-dresses.
The flames of these peculiar hats lit
up the inspired devotees, and showed their heads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
wrapped in plain linen wimples or some little
unaffected caps. But the ashes were hardly cold
before the gray light of the next day showed the
figure of the dreaded preacher small upon the
horizon, and lit upon the sewing-maids as they sat
making fresh steeples for the adornment of their
ladies&rsquo; heads.</p>

<p>Joan of Arc is dead, and another very different
apparition of womankind looms out of the mists
of history. Whilst Joan of Arc is hymned and
numbered among the happy company of saints
triumphant, Jane Shore is roared in drinking-songs
and ballads of a disreputable order, and is held
up as an awful example. She has for years been
represented upon the boards of West End and
Surrey-side theatres&mdash;in her prime as the mistress
of Edward IV., in her penance before the church
door, and in her poverty and starvation, hounded
from house to house in a Christian country where
bread was denied to her. I myself have seen her
through the person of a stout, melancholy, and
h-less lady, who, dressed in a sort of burlesque
fish-wife costume, has lain dying on the prompt-side
of the stage, in a whirl of paper snow, while,
to the edification of the twopenny gallery, she has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
bewailed her evil life, and has been allowed, by
a munificent management, to die in the arms of
white-clad angels. There is a gleam of truth in
the representation, and you may see the real Jane
Shore in a high steeple head-dress, with a thin
veil thrown over it, with a frontlet or little loop
of black velvet over her forehead; in a high-waisted
dress, open in a <img src="images/v.png" width="13" height="15" alt="V" /> shape from shoulder
to waist, the opening laced over the square-cut
under-gown, the upper gown having a collar of fur
or silk, a long train, broad cuffs, perhaps 7 inches
long from the base of her fingers, with a broad,
coloured band about her waist, a broader trimming
of the same colour round the hem of her shirt, and
in long peaked shoes. In person of mean stature,
her hair dark yellow, her face round and full, her
eyes gray, and her countenance as cheerful as herself.
The second real picture of her shows you a
haggard woman, with her hair unbound and falling
about her shoulders, shivering in a shift, which she
clutches about her with one hand, while the other
holds a dripping candle; and the third picture
shows an old woman in dirty wimple and untidy
rags.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 164px;">
<img src="images/ecill121.png" width="164" height="250"
alt="Six types of head-dress for women" />
</div>

<p>There are many ways of making the steeple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
head-dress. For the most part they are long,
black-covered steeples, resting at an angle of forty-five
degrees to the head, the broad end having a
deep velvet band round it, with hanging sides,
which come to the level of the chin; the point end
has a long veil attached to it, which floats lightly
down, or is carried on to one shoulder. Sometimes
this steeple hat is worn over a hood, the cape
of which is tucked into the dress.
Some of these hats have a jutting,
upturned piece in front, and they
are also covered with all manner
of coloured stuffs, but not commonly
so. All persons having an
income of &pound;10 a year and over
will have that black velvet loop,
the frontlet, sewn into their hats.
There is another new shape for hats, varying in
height from 8 to 18 inches. It is a cylinder,
broader at the top than the bottom, the crown
sometimes flat and sometimes rounded into the hat
itself; this hat is generally jewelled, and covered
with rich material. The veils are attached to these
hats in several ways; either they float down behind
from the centre of the crown of the hat, or they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
are sewn on to the base of the hat, and are supported
on wires, so as to shade the face, making a
roof over it, pointed in front and behind, or flat
across the front and bent into a point behind, or
circular. Take two circles of wire, one the size
of the base of your hat and the other larger, and
dress your linen or thin silk upon them; then you
may pinch the wire into any variations of squares
and circles you please.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 373px;">

<p class="caption">A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF EDWARD IV. (1461-1483)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">She wears the high hennin from which hangs a wisp
of linen. On her forehead is the velvet frontlet, and
across her forehead is a veil stretched on wires.</p>

<p>The veil was sometimes worn all over the steeple
hat, coming down over the face, but stiff enough
to stand away from it. Towards the
end of the reign the hats were not so
high or so erect.</p>

<p>Remember, also, that the horned
head-dress of the previous reign is not
by any means extinct.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/ecill122.png" width="80" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of Edward IV." />
</div>

<p>There remain two more forms of
making the human face hideous: one
is the head-dress closely resembling an
enormous sponge bag, which for some
unknown reason lasted well into the reign
of Henry VII. as a variety to the fashionable
head-gear of that time, and the other is very
simple, being a wimple kept on the head by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
circular stuffed hoop of material, which showed,
plain and severe across the forehead. The simple
folk wore a hood of linen, with a liripipe and wide
ear-flaps.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 119px;">
<img src="images/ecill123.png" width="119" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of Edward IV." />
</div>

<p>The dresses are plain in cut; they are all short-waisted
if at all fashionable. The most of them
have a broad waist-belt, and very deep borders to
their skirts; they have broad, turned-back
cuffs, often of black. These
cuffs, on being turned down over the
hand, show the same colour as the
dress; they are, in fact, the old long
cuff over the fingers turned back for
comfort.</p>

<p>It is by the variety of openings
at the necks of the gowns that you may get change.
First, let me take the most ordinary&mdash;that is, an
opening of a <img src="images/v.png" width="13" height="15" alt="V" /> shape from shoulders to waist, the
foot of the <img src="images/v.png" width="13" height="15" alt="V" /> at the waist, the points on the top of
the shoulders at the join of the arm. Across this
opening is seen, cut square and coming up to the
base of the bosom, the under-gown. You may
now proceed to vary this by lacing the <img src="images/v.png" width="13" height="15" alt="V" /> across,
but not drawing it together, by having the
<img src="images/v.png" width="13" height="15" alt="V" /> fur-edged, or made to turn over in a collar of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
black upon light material, or its opposite, by showing
a vest of stuff other than that of the under-gown,
which will then make a variety of colour
when the skirt is held up over the arm. Or you
may have your dress so cut that it is high in front
and square cut, and over this you may sew a false
<img src="images/v.png" width="13" height="15" alt="V" /> collar wither to or above the waist. I have said
that the whole neck-opening may be
covered by a gorget of cloth, which
was pinned up to the steeple hat, or by
a hood of thin stuff or silk, the cape
of which was tucked into the dress.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 90px;">
<img src="images/ecill124.png" width="90" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of Edward IV." />
</div>

<p>The lady, I think, is now complete
down to her long-pointed shoes, her
necklet of stones or gold chain, with
cross or heraldic pendant, and it
remains to show that the countrywoman
dressed very plainly, in a
decent-fitting dress, with her waist in its proper
place, her skirt full, the sleeves of her dress turned
back like my lady&rsquo;s, her head wrapped in a wimple
or warmed in a hood, her feet in plain, foot-shaped
shoes, and wooden clogs strapped on to
them for outdoor use or kitchen work; in fact,
she looked much like any old body to-day who has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
lived in a village, except that the wimple and the
hood then worn are out of place to-day, more&rsquo;s
the pity!</p>

<p>No doubt ladies were just human in those days,
and fussed and frittered over an inch or so of
hennin, or a yard or two of train. One cut her
dress too low to please the others, and another
wore her horned head-dress despite the dictates
of Fashion, which said, &lsquo;Away with horns, and
into steeples.&rsquo; No doubt the tall hennins, with
their floating veils, looked like black masts with
silken sails, and the ladies like a crowd of shipping,
with velvet trains for waves about their feet; no
doubt the steeples swayed and the silks rustled
when the heads turned to look at the fine men
in the days when hump-shouldered Richard was a
dandy.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 217px;">
<img src="images/ecill125.png" width="217" height="250"
alt="Three men of the time of Edward V. and Richard III." />
</div>

<p>Fashion&rsquo;s pulse beat very
weak in the spring of 1483.
More attune to the pipes of
Fate were the black cloaks of
conspirators and a measured
tread of soft-shoed feet than
lute and dance of airy millinery.
The axe of the executioner
soiled many white shirts, and dreadful
forebodings fluttered the dovecots of high-hennined
ladies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
The old order was dying; Medievalism, which
made a last spluttering flame in the next reign,
was now burnt low, and was saving for that last
effort. When Richard married Anne Neville, in the
same year was Raphael born in Italy; literature was
beginning, thought was beginning; many of the
great spirits of the Renaissance were alive and
working in Italy; the very trend of clothes showed
something vaguely different, something which
shows, however, that the foundations of the world
were being shaken&mdash;so shaken that men and women,
coming out of the gloom of the fourteenth century
through the half-light of the fifteenth, saw the first
signs of a new day, the first show of spring,
and, with a perversity or an eagerness to meet
the coming day, they began to change their
clothes.</p>

<p>It is in this reign of Richard III. that we get,
for the men, a hint of the peculiar magnificence
of the first years of the sixteenth century; we get
the first flush of those wonderful patterns which
are used by Memline and Holbein, those variations
of the pine-apple pattern, and of that peculiar convention
which is traceable in the outline of the
Tudor rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
The men, at first sight, do not appear very
different to the men of Edward IV.&rsquo;s time; they
have the long hair, the general clean-shaven faces,
open-breasted tunics, and full-pleated skirts. But,
as a rule, the man, peculiar to his time, the clothes-post
of his age, has discarded the tall peaked hat,
and is almost always dressed in the black velvet,
stiff-brimmed hat. The pleated skirt to his tunic
has grown longer, and his purse has grown larger;
the sleeves are tighter, and the old tunic with the
split, hanging sleeves has grown fuller, longer, and
has become an overcoat, being now open all the
way down. You will see that the neck of the
tunic is cut very low, and that you may see above
it, above the black velvet with which it is so often
bound, the rich colour or fine material of an undergarment,
a sort of waistcoat, and yet again above
that the straight top of a finely-pleated white
shirt. Sometimes the sleeves of the tunic will be
wide, and when the arm is flung up in gesticulation,
the baggy white shirt, tight-buttoned at the wrist,
will show. Instead of the overcoat with the hanging
sleeves, you will find a very plain-cut overcoat,
with sleeves comfortably wide, and with little plain
lapels to the collar. It is cut wide enough in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
back to allow for the spread of the tunic. Black
velvet is becoming a very fashionable trimming,
and will be seen as a border or as under-vest to
show between the shirt and the tunic. No clothes
of the last reign will be incongruous in this;
the very short tunics which expose the cod-piece,
the split-sleeve tunic, all the variations, I
have described. Judges walk about, looking like
gentlemen of the time of Richard II.: a judge
wears a long loose gown, with wide sleeves, from
out of which appear the sleeves of his under-tunic,
buttoned from elbow to wrist; he wears a cloak
with a hood, the cloak split up the right side, and
fastened by three buttons upon the right shoulder.
A doctor is in very plain, ample gown, with a
cape over his shoulders and a small round
cap on his head. His gown is not bound at the
waist.</p>

<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF RICHARD III. (1483-1485)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">Here one sees the first of the broad-toed shoes and
the birth of the Tudor costume&mdash;the full pleated
skirts and the prominence of white shirt.</p>

<p>The blunt shoes have come into fashion, and
with this the old long-peaked shoe dies for ever.
Common-sense will show you that the gentlemen
who had leisure to hunt in these times did not
wear their most foppish garments, that the tunics
were plain, the boots high, the cloaks of strong
material. They wore a hunting-hat, with a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
peak over the eyes and a little peak over the neck
at the back; a broad band passed under the chin,
and, buttoning on to either side of the hat, kept it
in place. The peasant wore a loose tunic, often
open-breasted and laced across; he had a belt
about his waist, a hood over his head, and often
a broad-brimmed Noah&rsquo;s Ark hat over the hood;
his slops, or loose trousers, were tied below the
knee and at the ankles. A shepherd
would stick his pipe in his
belt, so that he might march before
his flock, piping them into the
fold.</p>

<p>To sum up, you must picture a
man in a dress of Edward IV.&rsquo;s time, modified,
or, rather, expanded or expanding into the costume
of Henry VII.&rsquo;s time&mdash;a reign, in fact, which
hardly has a distinct costume to itself&mdash;that is, for
the men&mdash;but has a hand stretched out to two
centuries, the fifteenth and the sixteenth; yet, if
I have shown the man to you as I myself can see
him, he is different from his father in 1461, and
will change a great deal before 1500.</p>

<h3>THE WOMEN</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 104px;">
<img src="images/ecill127.png" width="104" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of Edward V. and Richard III." />
</div>

<p>Here we are at the end of an epoch,
at the close of a costume period, at one
of those curious final dates in a history
of clothes which says that within a
year or so the women of one time
will look hopelessly old-fashioned and
queer to the modern woman. Except
for the peculiar sponge-bag turban,
which had a few years of life in it, the
woman in Henry VII.&rsquo;s reign would look back at
this time and smile, and the young woman would
laugh at the old ideas of beauty. The River of
Time runs under many bridges, and it would seem
that the arches were low to the Bridge of Fashion
in 1483, and the steeple hat was lowered to prevent
contact with them. The correct angle of forty-five
degrees changed into a right angle, the steeple
hat, the hennin, came toppling down, and an embroidered
bonnet, perched right on the back of the
head, came into vogue. It is this bonnet which
gives, from our point of view, distinction to the
reign. It was a definite fashion, a distinct halt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
It had travelled along the years of the fourteenth
century, from the wimple and the horns, and the
stiff turbans, and the boxes of stiffened cloth of
gold; it had languished in the caul and blossomed
in the huge wimple-covered horns; it had shot
up in the hennin; and now it gave, as its last
transformation, this bonnet at the back of
the head, with the stiff wimple stretched upon
wires. Soon was to come the diamond-shaped
head-dress, and after that the birth of hair as a
beauty.</p>

<p>In this case the hair was drawn as tightly as
possible away from the forehead, and at the forehead
the smaller hairs were plucked away; even
eyebrows were a little out of fashion. Then
this cylindrical bonnet was placed at the back
of the head, with its wings of thin linen stiffly
sewn or propped on wires. These wires were
generally of a <img src="images/v.png" width="13" height="15" alt="V" /> shape, the
<img src="images/v.png" width="13" height="15" alt="V" /> point at the forehead.
On some occasions two straight wires
came out on either side of the face in addition
to the <img src="images/v.png" width="13" height="15" alt="V" />, and so made two wings on either
side of the face and two wings over the back of
the head. It is more easy to describe through
means of the drawings, and the reader will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
soon see what bend to give to the wires in
order that the wings may be properly held
out.</p>

<p>Beyond this head-dress there was very little
alteration in the lady&rsquo;s dress since the previous
reign. The skirts were full; the waist was high,
but not absurdly so; the band round the dress
was broad; the sleeves were tight; and the
cuffs, often of fur, were folded back to a good
depth.</p>

<p>The neck opening of the dress varied, as did
that of the previous reign, but whereas the most
fashionable opening was then from neck to waist,
this reign gave more liking to a higher corsage,
over the top of which a narrow piece of stuff
showed, often of black velvet. We may safely
assume that the ladies followed the men in the
matter of broad shoes. For a time the old fashion
of the long-tongued belt came in, and we see
instances of such belts being worn with the tongue
reaching nearly to the feet, tipped with a metal
ornament.</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">The great erection on her head is made of thin linen
stretched upon wires; through this one may see her
jewelled cap.</p>

<p>Not until night did these ladies discard their
winged head erections; not until the streets were
dark, and the brass basins swinging from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
barbers&rsquo; poles shone but dimly, and the tailors no
longer sat, cross-legged, on the benches in their
shop-fronts&mdash;then might my lady uncover her head
and talk, in company with my lord, over the
strange new stories of Prester John and of the
Wandering Jew; then, at her proper time, she will
go to her rest and sleep soundly beneath her
embroidered quilt, under the protection of the
saints whose pictures she has sewn into the corners
of it. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, bless the
bed that she lies on.</p>

<p>So we come to an end of a second series of
dates, from the First Edward to the Third Richard,
and we leave them to come to the Tudors and
their follies and fantastics; we leave an age that is
quaint, rich, and yet fairly simple, to come to an
age of padded hips and farthingales, monstrous
ruffs, knee-breeks, rag-stuffed trunks, and high-heeled
shoes.</p>

<p>With the drawings and text you should be able
to people a vast world of figures, dating from the
middle of the thirteenth century, 1272, to nearly
the end of the fifteenth, 1485, and if you allow
ordinary horse-sense to have play, you will be able
to people your world with correctly-dressed figures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
in the true inspiration of their time. You cannot
disassociate the man from his tailor; his clothes
must appeal to you, historically and soulfully, as
an outward and visible sign to the graces and vices
of his age and times.</p>

<h3>THE MEN</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 171px;">
<img src="images/ecill128.png" width="171" height="250"

</div>

<p>Everyone has felt that
curious faint aroma, that
sensation of lifting, which
proclaims the first day of
Spring and the burial of
Winter. Although nothing
tangible has taken place,
there is in the atmosphere
a full-charged suggestion of
promise, of green-sickness;
there is a quickening of
the pulse, a thrumming of the heart, and many
an eager, quick glance around for the first buds
of the new order of things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
England&rsquo;s winter was buried on Bosworth Field:
England&rsquo;s spring, as if by magic, commenced with
Henry&rsquo;s entry into London.</p>

<p>The first picture of the reign shows the mayor,
the sheriffs, and the aldermen, clothed in violet,
waiting at Shoreditch for the coming of the victor.
The same day shows Henry in St. Paul&rsquo;s, hearing
a <i>Te Deum</i>; in the Cathedral church, packed to
its limit, three new banners waved, one bearing a
figure of St. George, another a dragon of red on
white and green sarcenet, and the third showed a
dun cow on yellow tarterne.</p>

<p>Spring, of course, does not, except in a poetic
sense, burst forth in a day, there are long months
of preparation, hints, signs in the air, new notes
from the throats of birds.</p>

<p>The springtime of a country takes more than
the preparation of months. Nine years before
Henry came to the throne Caxton was learning
to print in the little room of Collard Mansion&mdash;he
was to print his &lsquo;Facts of Arms,&rsquo; joyous tales
and pleasant histories of chivalry, by especial desire
of Henry himself.</p>

<p>Later still, towards the end of the reign, the
first book of travel in the West began to go from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
hand to hand&mdash;it was written by Amerigo Vespucci,
cousin to La Bella Simonetta.</p>

<p>Great thoughts were abroad, new ideas were
constantly under discussion, the Arts rose to the
occasion and put forth flowers of beauty on many
stems long supposed to be dead or dormant and
incapable of improvement. It was the great age
of individual English expression in every form
but that of literature and painting, both these
arts being but in their cradles; Chaucer and
Gower and Langland had written, but they lay
in their graves long before new great minds arose.</p>

<p>The clouds of the Middle Ages were dispersed,
and the sun shone.</p>

<p>The costume was at once dignified and magnificent&mdash;not
that one can call the little coats great
ideals of dignity, but even they, by their richness
and by the splendour of the persons they adorned,
come into the category.</p>

<p>The long gowns of both men and women were
rich beyond words in colour, texture, and design,
they were imposing, exact, and gorgeous. Upon
a fine day the streets must have glittered when a
gentleman or lady passed by.</p>

<p>The fashions of the time have survived for us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
in the Court cards: take the jacks, knaves, valets&mdash;call
them as you will, and you will see the
costume of this reign but slightly modified into
a design, the cards of to-day and the cards of that
day are almost identical. Some years ago the
modification was less noticeable; I can remember
playing Pope Joan with cards printed
with full-length figures, just as the
illustrations to &lsquo;Alice in Wonderland&rsquo;
are drawn. In the knave you
will see the peculiar square hat which
came in at this time, and the petti-cote,
the long coat, the big sleeve,
and the broad-toed shoes. You will
see the long hair, undressed and
flowing over the shoulders (the professional
classes, as the lawyer, cut
their hair close, so also did the peasant). Over
this flowing hair a dandy would wear a little cap
with a narrow, rolled-up brim, and over this, on
occasions, an enormous hat of felt, ornamented
with a prodigious quantity of feathers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 99px;">
<img src="images/ecill129.png" width="99" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Henry VII." />
</div>

<p>There was, indeed, quite a choice of hats: the
berretino&mdash;a square hat pinched in at the corners;
many round hats, some with a high, tight brim,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
some with the least brim possible; into these
brims, or into a band round the hat, one might
stick feathers or pin a brooch.</p>

<p class="caption ipadbase">A MAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY VII. (1485-1509)</p>

<p>The chaperon, before described, was still worn
by Garter Knights at times, and by official, legal,
civic, and college persons.</p>

<p>What a choice of coats the gentlemen had, and
still might be in the fashion! Most common
among these was the long coat like a dressing-gown,
hanging upon the ground all round, with
a wide collar, square behind, and turning back in
the front down to the waist&mdash;this was the general
shape of the collar, and you may vary it on this
idea in every way: turn it back and show the
stuff to the feet, close it up nearly to the neck,
cut it off completely. Now for the sleeves of such
a coat. I have shown in the illustrations many
varieties, the most common was the wide sleeve,
narrow at the shoulder, and hanging over the hand
in folds. The slashes, which show the white shirt,
are usual, and of every order. The shirt itself
was often ornamented with fine gathers and fancy
stitching, and was gathered about the neck by a
ribbon. As the years went on it is easy to see
that the shirt was worn nearer to the neck, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"><!-- original location - coats and hats illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
gathers became higher and higher, became more
ornamented, and finally rose, in all extravagant
finery, to behind the ears&mdash;and we have the Elizabethan
ruff.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;">
<img src="images/ecill130.png" width="381" height="600"
alt="Three types of coat and five types of hat" />
</div>

<p>Next to the shirt a waistcoat, or stomacher, of
the most gorgeous patterned stuff, laced across
the breast sometimes, more often fastened behind.
This reached to the waist where it met long hose
of every scheme of colour&mdash;striped, dotted, divided
in bands&mdash;everything&mdash;displaying the indelicate
but universal pouch in front, tied with coloured
ribbons.</p>

<p>On the feet, shoes of all materials, from cloth
and velvet to leather beautifully worked, and of
the most absurd length; these also were slashed
with puffs of white stuff. Many of these shoes
were but a sole and a toe, and were tied on by
thongs passing through the sole.</p>

<p>Of course the long coat would not alone satisfy
the dandy, but he must needs cut it off into a
short jacket, or petti-cote, and leave it open to
better display his marvellous vest. Here we have
the origin of the use of the word &lsquo;petticoat&rsquo;&mdash;now
wrongly applied; in Scotland, to this day, a
woman&rsquo;s skirts are called her &lsquo;coats.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
About the waists of these coats was a short
sash, or a girdle, from which hung a very elaborate
purse, or a dagger.</p>

<p>Stick in hand, jewel in your hat, dandy&mdash;extravagant,
exquisite dandy! All ages know
you, from the day you choose your covering of
leaves with care, to the hour of your white duck
motoring-suit: a very bird of a man, rejoicing in
your plumage, a very human ass, a very narrow
individual, you stride, strut, simper through the
story of the universe, a perfect monument of the
Fall of Man, a gorgeous symbol of the decay of
manhood. In this our Henry&rsquo;s reign, your hair
busheth pleasantly, and is kembed prettily over
the ear, where it glimmers as gold i&rsquo; the sun&mdash;pretty
fellow&mdash;Lord! how your feathered bonnet
becomes you, and your satin stomacher is brave
over a padded chest. Your white hands, freed
from any nasty brawls and clean of any form of
work, lie in their embroidered gloves. Your pride
forbids the carriage of a sword, which is borne
behind you&mdash;much use may it be!&mdash;by a mincing
fellow in your dainty livery. And if&mdash;oh, rare
disguise!&mdash;your coiffure hides a noble brow, or
your little, neat-rimmed coif a clever head, less

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
honour be to you who dress your limbs to imitate
the peacock, and hide your mind beneath the
weight of scented clothes.</p>

<p>In the illustrations to this chapter and the next,
my drawings are collected and redrawn in my
scheme from works so beautiful and highly finished
that every student should go to see them for
himself at the British Museum. My drawings,
I hope, make it quite clear what was worn in
the end of the fifteenth century and the first nine
years of the sixteenth, and anyone with a slight
knowledge of pictures will be able to supply
themselves with a large amount of extra matter.
I would recommend MS. Roy 16, F. 2; MS.
Roy 19, C. 8; and especially Harleian MS. 4425.</p>

<p>Of the lower classes, also, these books show
quite a number. There are beggars and peasants,
whose dress was simply old-fashioned and very
plain; they wore the broad shoes and leather belts
and short coats, worsted hose, and cloaks of fair
cloth. &lsquo;Poverty,&rsquo; the old woman with the spoon
in her hat, is a good example of the poor of the
time.</p>

<p>When one knows the wealth of material of the
time, and has seen the wonder of the stuffs, one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
knows that within certain lines imagination may
have full scope. Stuffs of silk, embroidered with
coupled birds and branches, and flowers following
out a prescribed line, the embroideries edged and
sewn with gold thread; velvet on velvet, short-napped
fustian, damasked stuffs and diapered stuffs&mdash;what
pictures on canvas, or on the stage, may
be made; what marvels of colour
walked about the streets in those
days! It was to the eye an age of
elaborate patterns&mdash;mostly large&mdash;and
all this broken colour and glitter of
gold thread must have made the
streets gay indeed.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 86px;">
<img src="images/ecill132.png" width="86" height="250"

</div>

<p>Imagine, shall we say, Corfe Castle
on a day when a party of ladies and
gentlemen assembled to &lsquo;course a
stagge,&rsquo; when the huntsmen, in green,
gathered in the outer ward, and the grooms, in
fine coloured liveries, held the gaily-decked
horses; then, from the walls lined with archers,
would come the blast of the horn, and out
would walk my lord and my lady, with knights,
and squires, and ladies, and gallants, over the
bridge across the castle ditch, between the round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
towers. Behind them the dungeon tower, and
the great gray mass of the keep&mdash;all a fitting and
impressive background to their bravery.</p>

<p>The gentlemen, in long coats of all wonderful
colours and devices, with little hats, jewelled and
feathered, with boots to the knee of soft leather,
turned back in colours at the top;
on their left hands the thick hawking
glove on which, jessed and
hooded, sits the hawk&mdash;for some
who will not go with the hounds
will fly the hawk on the Isle of
Purbeck.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 88px;">
<img src="images/ecill133.png" width="88" height="250"

</div>

<p>Below, in the town over the moat,
a crowd is gathered to see them off&mdash;merchants
in grave colours, and
coats turned back with fur, their
ink-horns slung at their waists, with
pens and dagger and purse; beggars; pilgrims,
from over seas, landed at Poole Harbour, in long
gowns, worn with penitence and dusty travels,
shells in their hats, staffs in their hands; wide-eyed
children in smocks; butchers in blue; men
of all guilds and women of all classes.</p>

<p>The drawbridge is down, the portcullis up, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
the party, gleaming like a bed of flowers in their
multi-coloured robes, pass over the bridge, through
the town, and into the valley.</p>

<p>The sun goes in and leaves the grim castle, gray
and solemn, standing out against the green of the
hills....</p>

<p>And of Henry himself, the great Tudor, greater,
more farseeing than the eighth Henry, a man
who so dominates the age, and fills it with his
spirit, that no mental picture is complete without
him. His fine, humorous face, the quizzical eye,
the firm mouth, showing his character. The great
lover of art, of English art, soon to be pulverized
by pseudo-classic influences; the man who pulled
down the chapel at the west end of Westminster
Abbey with the house by it&mdash;Chaucer&rsquo;s house&mdash;to
make way for that superb triumph of ornate
building, his chapel, beside which the mathematical
squares and angles of classic buildings
show as would boxes of bricks by a gorgeous
flower.</p>

<p>The stories against him are, in reality, stories
for him, invented by those whom he kept to their
work, and whom he despoiled of their ill-gotten
gains. He borrowed, but he paid back in full;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
he came into a disordered, distressed kingdom,
ruled it by fear&mdash;as had to be done in those days&mdash;and
left it a kingdom ready for the fruits of his
ordered works&mdash;to the fleshy beast who so nearly
ruined the country. What remained, indeed, was
the result of his father&rsquo;s genius.</p>


<h3>THE WOMEN</h3>

<p>Take up a pack of cards and look at the queen.
You may see the extraordinary head-gear as worn
by ladies at the end of the fifteenth century and
in the first years of the sixteenth, worn in a
modified form all through the next reign, after
which that description of head-dress vanished for
ever, its place to be taken by caps, hats, and
bonnets.</p>

<p>The richest of these head-dresses were made of
a black silk or some such black material, the top
stiffened to the shape of a sloping house-roof, the
edges falling by the face on either side&mdash;made
stiff, so as to stand parallel&mdash;these were sewn
with gold and pearls on colour or white. The
end of the hood hung over the shoulders and
down the back; this was surmounted by a stole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span>
of stiffened material, also richly sewn with jewels,
and the whole pinned on to a close-fitting cap of
a different colour, the edge of which showed above
the forehead.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 415px;">
<img src="images/ecill134.png" width="415" height="450"
alt="Seven head-dresses for women; side and front view of a shoe" />
</div>

<p>The more moderate head-dress was of black
again, but in shape nearly square, and slit at the
sides to enable it to hang more easily over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
shoulders. It was placed over a coif, often of
white linen or of black material, was turned over
from the forehead, folded, and pinned back; often
it was edged with gold.</p>

<p>On either side of the hood were hanging
ornamental metal-tipped tags to tie back the hood
from the shoulders, and this became, in time&mdash;that
is, at the end of the reign&mdash;the ordinary
manner of wearing them, till they were finally
made up so.</p>

<p>The ordinary head-dress was of white linen,
crimped or embroidered in white, made in a piece
to hang over the shoulders and down the back,
folded back and stiffened in front to that peculiar
triangular shape in fashion; this was worn by the
older women over a white hood.</p>

<p>The plain coif, or close-fitting linen cap, was
the most general wear for the poor and middle
classes.</p>

<p>The hair was worn long and naturally over
the shoulders by young girls, and plainly parted
in the centre and dressed close to the head by
women wearing the large head-dress.</p>

<p>Another form of head-dress, less common, was
the turban&mdash;a loose bag of silk, gold and pearl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
embroidered, fitting over the hair and forehead
tightly, and loose above.</p>

<p>The gowns of the women were very simply
cut, having either a long train or no train at all,
these last cut to show the under-skirt of some
fine material, the bodice of which showed above
the over gown at the shoulders. The ladies who
wore the
long gown
generally
had it lined
with some
fine fur,
and to prevent
this
dragging in
the mud, as
also to show
the elegance of their furs, they fastened the train
to a button or brooch placed at the back of the
waistband. This, in time, developed into the
looped skirts of Elizabethan times.</p>

<p>The bodice of the gown was square cut and not
very low, having an ornamental border of fur,
embroidery, or other rich coloured material sewn on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
to it. This border went sometimes round the
shoulders and down the front of the dress to below
the knees. Above the bodice was nearly always
seen the <img src="images/v.png" width="13" height="15" alt="V" />-shaped opening of the under petticoat
bodice, and across and above that, the white
embroidered or crimped chemise.</p>

<p>The sleeves were as the men&rsquo;s&mdash;tight all the
way down from the shoulder to the wrist, the
cuffs coming well over the first
joints of the fingers (sometimes
these cuffs are turned back to show
elaborate linings), or they were made
tight at the shoulder and gradually
looser until they became very full
over the lower arm, edged or lined
with fur or soft silk, or loose and
baggy all the way from shoulder to
hand.</p>

<p>At this time Bruges became
world-famed for her silken texture; her satins were
used in England for church garments and other
clothes. The damask silks were greatly in use,
and were nearly always covered with the peculiar
semi-Spanish pattern, the base of which was some
contortion of the pomegranate. Some of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
patterns were small and wonderfully fine, depending
on their wealth of detail for their magnificent
appearance, others were huge, so that but few
repeats of the design appeared on the dress. Block-printed
linens were also in use, and the samples
in South Kensington will show how beautiful and
artistic they were, for all their simple design. As
Bruges supplied us with silks, satins, and velvets,
the last also beautifully damasked, Ypr&egrave;s sent
her linen to us, and the whole of Flanders sent
us painters and illuminators who worked in England
at the last of the great illuminated books, but this
art died as printing and illustrating by wood-blocks
came in to take its place.</p>

<p>Nearly every lady had her own common linen,
and often other stuffs, woven in her own house,
and the long winter evenings were great times
for the sewing chambers, where the lady and her
maids sat at the looms. To-day one may see in
Bruges the women at the cottage doors busy over
their lace-making, and the English women by the
sea making nets&mdash;so in those times was every
woman at her cottage door making coarse linens
and other stuffs to earn her daily bread, while
my lady was sitting in her chamber weaving, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
embroidering a bearing cloth for her child against
her time.</p>

<p>However, the years of the Wars of the Roses
had had their effect on every kind of English
work, and as the most elegant books were painted
and written by Flemings, as the finest linen came
from Ypr&egrave;s, the best silks and velvets from Bruges,
the great masters of painting from Florence,
Germany, and Belgium, so also the elaborate and
wonderful embroidery, for which we had been so
famous, died away, and English work was but
coarse at the best, until, in the early sixteen
hundreds, the new style came into use of raising
figures some height above the ground-work of
the design, and the rich embroidery of the Stuart
times revived this art.</p>

<p>I have shown that this age was the age of fine
patterns, as some ages are ages of quaint cut, and
some of jewel-laden dresses, and some of dainty
needlework.</p>

<p>A few ladies wore their gowns open to the
waist to show the stomacher, as the men did,
and open behind to the waist, laced across,
the waist being embraced by a girdle of the
shape so long in use, with long ends and metal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
ornaments; the girdle held the purse of the
lady.</p>

<p class="caption">A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY VII. (1485-1509)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadboth">Notice the diamond-shaped head-dress, the wide,
fur-edged gown with its full sleeves.</p>

<p>The illustrations given with this chapter show
very completely the costume of this time, and,
except in cases of royal persons or very gorgeously
apparelled ladies, they are complete enough to
need no description.</p>

<p>The shoes, it will be seen, are very broad at
the toes, with thick soles, sometimes made much
in the manner of sandals&mdash;that is, with only a
toecap, the rest flat, to be tied on by strings.</p>

<p>As this work is entirely for use, it may be said,
that artists who have costumes made for them,
and costumiers who make for the stage, hardly
ever allow enough material for the gowns worn
by men and women in this and other reigns, where
the heaviness and richness of the folds was the
great keynote. To make a gown, of such a kind
as these good ladies wore, one needs, at least,
twelve yards of material, fifty-two inches wide,
to give the right appearance. It is possible to
acquire at many of the best shops nowadays
actual copies of embroidered stuffs, velvets, and
damask silks of this time, and of stuffs up to
Early Victorian patterns, and this makes it easy for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244]</a></span>
painters to procure what, in other days, they were
forced to invent.</p>

<p>Many artists have their costumes made of
Bolton sheeting, on to which they stencil the
patterns they wish to use&mdash;this is not a bad
thing to do, as sheeting is not dear and it falls
into beautiful folds.</p>

<p>The older ladies and widows of this time
nearly all dressed in very simple, almost conventual
garments, many of them wearing the
&lsquo;barbe&rsquo; of pleated linen, which covered the lower
part of the face and the chin&mdash;a sort of linen beard&mdash;it
reached to the breast, and is still worn by
some religious orders of women.</p>

<p>Badges were still much in use, and the servants
always wore some form of badge on their left
sleeve&mdash;either merely the colours of their masters,
or a small silver, or other metal, shield. Thus,
the badge worn by the servants of Henry VII.
would be either a greyhound, a crowned hawthorn
bush, a red dragon, a portcullis, or the red and
white roses joined together. The last two were
used by all the Tudors, and the red rose and the
portcullis are still used. From these badges we
get the signs of many of our inns, either started
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
by servants, who used their master&rsquo;s badge for a
device, or because the inn lay on a certain property
the lord of which carried chequers, or a red dragon,
or a tiger&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>I mentioned the silks of Bruges and her velvets
without giving enough prominence to the fine
velvets of Florence, a sample of which, a cope,
once used in Westminster Abbey, is preserved at
Stonyhurst College; it was left by Henry VII.
to &lsquo;Our Monastery of Westminster,&rsquo; and is of
beautiful design&mdash;a gold ground, covered with
boughs and leaves raised in soft velvet pile of
ruby colour, through which little loops of gold
thread appear.</p>

<p>I imagine Elizabeth of York, Queen to
Henry VII., of the subtle countenance&mdash;gentle
Elizabeth, who died in child-birth&mdash;proceeding
through London, from the Tower to Westminster,
to her coronation; the streets cleansed
and the houses hung with tapestry, arras and
gold cloth, the fine-coloured dresses of the
crowd, the armoured soldiers, all the rich estate
of the company about her, and the fine trappings
of the horses. Our Queen went to her coronation
with some Italian masts, paper flowers, and some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
hundreds of thousands of yards of bunting and
cheap flags; the people mostly in sombre clothes;
the soldiers in ugly red, stiff coats, were the only
colour of note passing down Whitehall, past the
hideous green stuck with frozen Members of
Parliament, to the grand, wonderful Abbey, which
has seen so many Queens crowned.</p>

<p>So, with songs and music of his own composition,
comes the richest man in Europe to the throne
of England. Gay, brave, tall, full of conceit in
his own strength, Henry, a king, a Tudor, a
handsome man, abounding in excellence of craft
and art, the inheritance from his father and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span>
mother, figures in our pageant a veritable symbol
of the Renaissance in England.</p>

<p>He had, in common with the marvellous
characters of that Springtime of History, the
quick intelligence and all the personal charm
that the age brought forth in abundance. In his
reign the accumulated mass of brain all over the
world budded and flowered; the time gave to us
a succession of the most remarkable people in any
historical period, and it is one of the triumphs of
false reasoning to prove this, in England, to have
been the result of the separation from the Catholic
Church. For centuries the Church had organized
and prepared the ground in which this tree of the
world&rsquo;s knowledge was planted, had pruned, cut
back, nursed the tree, until gradually it flowered,
its branches spread over Christian Europe, and
when the flowering branch hanging over England
gave forth its first-fruits, those men who ate of
the fruit and benefited by the shade were the first
to quarrel with the gardeners.</p>

<p>In these days there lived and died Botticelli,
Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, D&uuml;rer, Erasmus,
Holbein, Copernicus, Luther, Rabelais, and
Michael Angelo, to mention a few men of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
every shade of thought, and in this goodly time
came Henry to the English throne, to leave, at
his death, instead of the firm progress of order
instituted by his father, a bankrupt country with
an enormously rich Government.</p>

<p>You may see for the later pictures of his reign
a great bloated mass of corpulence, with running
ulcers on his legs and the blood of wives and
people on his hands, striding in his well-known
attitude over the festering slums his rule had
produced in London. Harry, <i>Grace &agrave; Dieu</i>!</p>

<p>The mental picture from our&mdash;costume&mdash;point
of view is widely different from that of the last
reign. No longer do we see hoods and cowls, brown,
gray, white, and black in the streets, no longer the
throngs of fine craftsmen, of church-carvers, gilders,
embroiderers, candle-makers, illuminators, missal-makers;
all these served but to swell the ranks
of the unemployed, and caused a new problem
to England, never since solved, of the skilled poor
out of work. The hospitals were closed&mdash;that
should bring a picture to your eyes&mdash;where the
streets had been thronged with the doctors of
the poor and of the rich in their habits, no monks
or lay brothers were to be seen. The sick, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"><!-- original location - Henry VIII costume illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>251]</a></span>
blind, the insane had no home but the overhung
back alleys where the foulest diseases might
accumulate and hot-beds of vice spring up, while
in the main streets Harry Tudor was carried to
his bear-baiting, a quivering mass of jewels shaking
on his corrupt body, on his thumb that wonderful
diamond the Regale of France, stolen by him from
the desecrated shrine of St.
Thomas &agrave; Becket.</p>

</div>

<p>There are two distinct
classes of fashion to be seen,
the German-Swiss fashion
and the English fashion, a
natural evolution of the
national dress. The German
fashion is that slashed,
extravagant-looking creation
which we know so well
from the drawings of Albert D&uuml;rer and the more
German designs of Holbein. The garments which
were known as &lsquo;blistered&rsquo; clothes are excessive
growths on to the most extravagant designs of the
Henry VII. date. The shirt cut low in the neck,
and sewn with black embroidery; the little waistcoat
ending at the waist and cut straight across from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>252]</a></span>
shoulder to shoulder, tied with thongs of leather or
coloured laces to the breeches, leaving a gap between
which showed the shirt; the universal pouch on
the breeches often highly decorated and jewelled.
From the line drawings you will see that the
sleeves and the breeches took every form, were
of any odd assortment of colours,
were cut, puffed, and splashed all
over, so that the shirt might be
pushed through the holes, looking
indeed &lsquo;blistered.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 108px;">
<img src="images/ecill139.png" width="108" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Henry VIII." />
</div>

<p>The shoes were of many shapes,
as I have shown, agreeing in one
point only&mdash;that the toes should
be cut very broad, often, indeed,
quite square.</p>

<p>Short or hanging hair, both
were the fashion, and little flat
caps with the rim cut at intervals,
or the large flat hats of the previous reign, covered
with feathers and curiously slashed, were worn
with these costumes.</p>

<p>Cloaks, as you may see, were worn over the
dress, and also those overcoats shaped much like
the modern dressing-gown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>253]</a></span>
It is from these &lsquo;blistered,&rsquo; padded breeches
that we derive the trunks of the next reign, the
slashings grown into long ribbon-like slits, the hose
puffed at the knee.</p>

<p>Separate pairs of sleeves were worn with the
waistcoats, or with the petti-cotes, a favourite
sleeve trimming being broad velvet bands.</p>

<p>The invention sprang, as usual, from necessity,
by vanity to custom. In 1477 the Swiss beat
and routed the Duke of Burgundy at Nantes, and
the soldiers, whose clothes were in rags, cut and
tore up his silk tents, his banners, all material
they could find, and made themselves clothes of
these odd pieces&mdash;clothes still so torn and ragged
that their shirts puffed out of every hole and rent.
The arrival of the victorious army caused all the
non-fighters to copy this curious freak in clothes,
and the courtiers perpetuated the event by proclaiming
blistering as the fashion.</p>

<p>The other and more usual fashion springs from
the habit of clothes in bygone reigns.</p>

<p>Let us first take the shirt A. It will be seen
how, in this reign, the tendency of the shirt was
to come close about the neck. The previous reign
showed us, as a rule, a shirt cut very low in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>254]</a></span>
neck, with the hem drawn together with laces;
these laces pulled more tightly together, thus
rucking the material into closer gathers, caused
the cut of the shirt to be altered and made so
that the hem frilled out round the neck&mdash;a collar,
in fact. That this collar took all forms under
certain limitations will be noticed, also that thick
necked gentlemen&mdash;Henry himself must have
invented this&mdash;wore the collar of the shirt turned
down and tied with strings of linen. The cuffs
of the shirt, when they showed at the wrist, were
often, as was the collar, sewn with elaborate
designs in black thread or silk.</p>

<p>Now we take the waistcoat B. As you may
see from the drawing showing the German form
of dress, this waistcoat was really a petti-cote,
a waistcoat with sleeves. This waistcoat was
generally of richly ornamented material (Henry
in purple satin, embroidered with his initials and the
Tudor rose; Henry in brocade covered with posies
made in letters of fine gold bullion). The material
was slashed and puffed or plain, and dependent
for its effect on the richness of its embroidery or
design of the fabric. It was worn with or without
sleeves; in most cases the sleeves were detachable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>255]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 331px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>256]</a></span>
The coat C. This coat was made with bases
like a frock, a skirted coat, in fact; the material
used was generally plain, of velvet, fine cloth, silk,
or satin. The varieties of cut were numerous,
and are shown in the drawings&mdash;open to the waist,
open all the way in front, close to the neck&mdash;every
way; where the coat was open in front it generally
parted to show the bragetto, or jewelled pouch.
It was a matter for choice spirits to decide whether
or no they should wear sleeves to their coats, or
show the sleeves of their waistcoats. No doubt
Madame Fashion saw to it that the changes were
rung sufficiently to make hay while the sun shone
on extravagant tastes. The coat was held at the
waist with a sash of silk tied in a bow with short
ends. Towards the end of the reign, foreshadowing
the Elizabethan jerkin or jacket, the custom
grew more universal of the coat with sleeves and
the high neck, the bases were cut shorter to show
the full trunks, and the waistcoat was almost
entirely done away with, the collar grew in proportion,
and spread, like the tail of an angry turkey,
in ruffle and folded pleat round the man&rsquo;s neck.</p>

<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY VIII. (1509-1547)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">This is the extreme German-English fashion. In
Germany and Switzerland this was carried to greater
lengths.</p>

<p>The overcoat D is the gown of the previous
reign cut, for the dandy, into a shorter affair,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>257]</a></span>
reaching not far below the knee; for the grave
man it remained long, but, for all, the collar had
changed to a wide affair stretching well over the
shoulders. It was made, this collar, of such stuff
as lined the cloak, maybe it was of fur, or of satin,
of silk, or of cloth of gold. The tremendous folds
of these overcoats gave
to the persons in them a
sense of splendour and
dignity; the short sleeves
of the fashionable overcoats,
puffed and swollen,
barred with rich <i>appliqu&eacute;</i>
designs or bars of fur,
reaching only to the
elbow, there to end in
a hem of fur or some
rich stuff, the collar as
wide as these padded
shoulders, all told in effect as garments which
gave a great air of well-being and richness to their
owner.</p>

</div>

<p>Of course, I suppose one must explain, the
sleeves varied in every way: were long, short,
full, medium full, according to taste. Sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>258]</a></span>
the overcoats were sleeveless. Beneath these
garments the trunks were worn&mdash;loose little
breeches, which, in the German style, were
bagged, puffed, rolled, and slashed in infinite
varieties. Let it be noticed that the cutting of
slashes was hardly ever a straight slit, but in the
curve of an elongated <img src="images/s.png" width="12" height="15" alt="S" />
or a double <img src="images/s.png" width="12" height="15" alt="S" /> curve.
Other slashes were squared top and bottom.</p>

<p>All men wore tight hose, in some cases puffed
at the knee; in fact, the bagging, sagging, and
slashing of hose suggested the separate breeches
or trunks of hose.</p>

<p>The little flat cap will be seen in all its varieties

<p>The Irish were forbidden by law to wear a
shirt, smock, kerchor, bendel, neckerchor, mocket
(a handkerchor), or linen cap coloured or dyed
with saffron; or to wear in
shirts or smocks above seven
yards of cloth.</p>

<p>To wear black genet you
must be royal; to wear sable
you must rank above a viscount;
to wear marten or velvet trimming
you must be worth over
two hundred marks a year.</p>

<p>Short hair came into fashion
about 1521.</p>

</div>

<p>So well known is the story
of Sir Philip Calthrop and John Drakes the
shoemaker of Norwich, who tried to ape the
fashion, that I must here allude to this ancestor
of mine who was the first of the dandies of note,
among persons not of the royal blood. The story
itself, retold in every history of costume, is to this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>260]</a></span>
effect: Drakes, the shoemaker, seeing that the
county talked of Sir Philip&rsquo;s clothes, ordered a
gown from the same tailor. This reached the ears
of Sir Philip, who then ordered his gown to be
cut as full of slashes as the shears could make it.
The ruin of cloth so staggered the shoemaker
that he vowed to keep to his own humble fashion
in future. No doubt Sir Philip&rsquo;s slashes were
cunningly embroidered round, and the gown made
rich and sparkling with the device of seed pearls so
much in use. This man&rsquo;s son, also Sir Philip, married
Amy, daughter of Sir William Boleyn, of Blickling,
Norfolk. She was aunt to Queen Anne Boleyn.</p>

<h3>THE WOMEN</h3>

<p>One cannot call to mind pictures of this time
without, in the first instance, seeing the form of
Henry rise up sharply before us followed by his
company of wives. The fat, uxorious giant comes
straight to the front of the picture, he dominates
the age pictorially; and, as a fitting background,
one sees the six women who were sacrificed on
the political altar to pander to his vanity.
Katherine of Aragon&mdash;the fine and noble lady&mdash;a
tool of political desires, cast off after Henry
had searched his precious conscience, after eighteen
years of married life, to find that he had scruples
as to the spirituality of the marriage. Anne
Boleyn, tainted with the life of the Court, a
pitiful figure in spite of all her odious crimes;
how often must a ghost, in a black satin nightdress
edged with black velvet, have haunted the
royal dreams. And the rest of them, clustered
round the vain king, while in the background
the great figures of the time loom hugely as they
play with the crowned puppets.</p>

<p>The note of the time, as we look at it with
our eyes keen on the picture, is the final evolution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>262]</a></span>
of the hood. Bit by bit, inch by inch, the plain
fabric has become enriched, each succeeding step
in an elaboration of the simple form; the border
next to the face is turned back, then the hood is
lined with fine stuff and the turnover shows this
to advantage; then the sides are split and the
back is made more full; then a tag is sewn on
to the sides by which means the cut side may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>263]</a></span>
be fastened off the shoulders. The front is now
stiffened and shaped at an angle, this front is
sewn with jewels, and, as the angle forms a gap
between the forehead and the point of the hood,
a pad is added to fill in the vacant space. At
last one arrives at the diamond-shaped head-dress
worn in this reign,
and, in this reign,
elaborated in every
way, elaborated, in
fact, out of existence.
In order to make the
head-dress in its 1509
state you must make
the white lining with
the jewelled turnover
as a separate cap.
However, I think
that the drawings speak for themselves more
plainly than I can write.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 213px;">
<img src="images/ecill146.png" width="213" height="250"
alt="Four types of head-dress for women" />
</div>

<p>Every device for crowding jewels together was
used, criss-cross, in groups of small numbers, in
great masses. Pendants were worn, hung upon
jewelled chains that wound twice round the neck,
once close to the neck, the second loop loose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>264]</a></span>
and passed, as a rule, under the lawn shift. Large
brooches decorated the bodices, brooches with drop
ornaments, the body of the brooch of fine gold
workmanship, many of them wrought in Italy.
The shift, delicately embroidered with black silk,
had often a band of jewellery upon it, and this
shift was square cut, following the shape of the
bodice.</p>

<p>The bodice of the gown was square cut and
much stiffened to a box-like shape. The sleeves
of the gown were narrow at the shoulders, and
after fitting the arm for about six inches down
from the shoulders, they widened gradually until,
just below the elbow, they became square and
very full; in this way they showed the false under-sleeve.
This under-sleeve was generally made of
a fine rich-patterned silk or brocade, the same
stuff which formed the under-gown; the sleeve
was a binding for the very full lawn or cambric
sleeve which showed in a ruffle at the wrist and
in great puffs under the forearm. The under-sleeve
was really more like a gauntlet, as it was
generally held together by buttoned tags; it was
puffed with other coloured silk, slashed to show
the shift, or it might be plain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>265]</a></span>
Now the sleeve of the gown was subject to
much alteration. It was, as I have described,
made very square and full at the elbow, and over
this some ladies wore a false sleeve of gold net&mdash;you
may imagine the length to which net will
go, studied with jewels,
crossed in many ways,
twisted into patterns,
sewn on to the sleeve
in sloping lines&mdash;but,
besides this, the sleeve
was turned back to
form a deep square
cuff which was often
made of black or
coloured velvet, or of
fur.</p>

</div>

<p>In all this I am
taking no account of
the German fashions, which I must describe separately.
Look at the drawings I have made of the
German fashion. I find that they leave me dumb&mdash;mere
man has but a limited vocabulary when the
talk comes to clothes&mdash;and these dresses that look
like silk pumpkins, blistered and puffed and slashed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>266]</a></span>
sewn in ribs, swollen, and altogether so queer,
are beyond the furious dashes that my pen makes
at truth and millinery. The costumes of the
people of this age have grown up in the minds
of most artists as being inseparable from the
drawings of Holbein and D&uuml;rer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 195px;">
<img src="images/ecill148.png" width="195" height="250"
alt="Two women of the time of Henry VIII." />
</div>

<p>Surely, I say to myself, most people who will
read this will know their Holbein and D&uuml;rer,
between whom there
lies a vast difference,
but who between them
show, the one, the estate
of England, and the
other, those most German
fashions which had
so powerful an influence
upon our own. Both
these men show the profusion
of richness, the
extravagant follies of the dress of their time,
how, to use the words of Pliny: &lsquo;We penetrate
into the bowels of the earth, digging veins of
gold and silver, and ores of brass and lead; we
seek also for gems and certain little pebbles.
Driving galleries into the depths, we draw out the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>267]</a></span>
bowels of the earth, that the gems we seek may
be worn on the finger. How many hands are
wasted in order that a single joint may sparkle!
If any hell there were, it had assuredly ere now
been disclosed by the borings of avarice and luxury!&rsquo;</p>

</div>

<p>Or in the writings of Tertullian, called by Sigismund
Feyerabendt,
citizen and
printer of Frankfort,
a &lsquo;most strict
censor who most
severely blames
women:&rsquo; &lsquo;Come
now,&rsquo; says Tertullian,
&lsquo;if from
the first both the
Milesians sheared
sheep, and the
Chinese spun from
the tree, and the
Tyrians dyed and the Phrygians embroidered,
and the Babylonians inwove; and if pearls shone
and rubies flashed, if gold itself, too, came up from
the earth with the desire for it; and if now, too,
no lying but the mirror&rsquo;s were allowed, Eve, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>268]</a></span>
suppose, would have desired these things on her
expulsion from Paradise, and when spiritually
dead.&rsquo;</p>

<p>One sees by the tortured and twisted German
fashion that the hair was plaited, and so, in
curves and twists, dropped into coarse gold-web
nets, thrust into web nets with velvet pouches to
them, so that the hair
stuck out behind in a great
knob, or at the side in
two protuberances; over
all a cap like to the
man&rsquo;s, but that it was
infinitely more feathered
and jewelled. Then,
again, they wore those
hideous barbes or beard-like
linen cloths, over the
chin, and an infinite variety of caps of linen
upon their heads&mdash;caps which showed always the
form of the head beneath.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 229px;">
<img src="images/ecill150.png" width="229" height="300"
alt="A woman of the time of Henry VIII.; three types of hat for women" />
</div>

<p>In common with the men, their overcoats and
cloaks were voluminous, and needed to be so if
those great sleeves had to be stuffed into them;
fur collars or silk collars, with facings to match,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>269]</a></span>
were rolled over to show little or great expanses
of these materials.</p>

<p>Here, to show what dainty creatures were our
lady ancestors, to show from what beef and blood
and bone we come, I give you (keep your eye
meanwhile upon the wonderful dresses) the daily
allowance of a Maid of Honour.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Every morning at breakfast one chyne of
beef from the kitchen, one chete loaf and one
maunchet at the pantry bar, and one gallon of
ale at the buttery bar.</p>

<p>For dinner a piece of beef, a stroke of roast
and a reward from the kitchen. A caste of
chete bread from the pantry bar, and a gallon
of ale at the buttery bar.</p>

<p>Afternoon&mdash;should they suffer the pangs
of hunger&mdash;a maunchet of bread from the
pantry bar, and a gallon of ale at the buttery
bar.</p>

<p>Supper, a messe of pottage, a piece of
mutton and a reward from the kitchen. A
caste of chete bread from the pantry bar, and
a gallon of ale at the buttery bar.</p>

<p>After supper&mdash;to insure a good night&rsquo;s rest&mdash;a
chete loaf and a maunchet from the
pantry bar, and half a gallon of ale from the
seller bar.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>270]</a></span>
Four and a half gallons of ale! I wonder did
they drink it all themselves? All this, and down
in the mornings in velvets and silks, with faces as
fresh as primroses.</p>

<p>It is the fate of all articles of clothing or adornment,
naturally tied or twisted, or folded and
pinned by the devotees of fashion, to become, after
some little time, made up, ready made, into the
shapes which had before some of the owner&rsquo;s mood
and personality about them. These hoods worn by
the women, these wide sleeves to the gowns, these
hanging sleeves to the overcoats, the velvet slip
of under-dress, all, in their time, became falsified
into ready-made articles. With the hoods you
can see for yourselves how they lend themselves
by their shape to personal taste; they were made
up, all ready sewn; where pins had been used, the
folds of velvet at the back were made steadfast,
the crimp of the white linen was determined, the
angle of the side-flap ruled by some unwritten law
of mode. In the end, by a process of evolution,
the diamond shape disappeared, and the cap was
placed further back on the head, the contour being
circular where it had previously been pointed.
The velvet hanging-piece remained at the back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>271]</a></span>
of the head, but was smaller, in one piece, and
was never pinned up, and the entire shape
gradually altered towards, and finally into, the
well-known Mary Queen of Scots head-dress,
with which every reader must be familiar.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 262px;">
<img src="images/ecill151.png" width="262" height="250"
alt="Two women of the time of Henry VIII." />
</div>

<p>It has often occurred to me while writing this
book that the absolute history of one such head-dress
would be
of more help
than these isolated
remarks,
which have to
be dropped only
to be taken up
in another reign,
but I have felt
that, after all,
the arrangement
is best as it
stands, because we can follow, if we are willing, the
complete wardrobe of one reign into the next,
without mixing the two up. It is difficult to
keep two interests running together, but I myself
have felt, when reading other works on the subject,
that the way in which the various articles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>272]</a></span>
of clothing are mixed up is more disturbing than
useful.</p>

<p>The wide sleeve to the gown, once part and
parcel of the gown, was at last made separate
from it&mdash;as a cuff more than a sleeve naturally
widening&mdash;and in the next reign, among the most
fashionable, left out altogether. The upper part
of the dress, once cut low and square to show
the under-dress, or a vest of other stuff, was now
made, towards the end of the reign, with a false
top of other stuff, so replacing the under-dress.</p>

<p>Lacing was carried to extremes, so that the body
was pinched into the hard roll-like appearance
always identified with this time; on the other
hand, many, wiser women I should say, were this
the place for morals, preferred to lace loose, and
show, beneath the lacing, the colour of the under-dress.</p>

<p>Many were the varieties of girdle and belt,
from plain silk sashes with tasselled ends to rich
jewelled chain girdles ending in heavy ornaments.</p>

<p>For detail one can do no better than go to
Holbein, the master of detail, and to-day, when
photographs of pictures are so cheap, and lives
of painters, copiously illustrated, are so easily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>273]</a></span>
attainable at low prices, it is the finest education,
not only in painting, but in Tudor atmosphere
and in matters of dress, to go straightway and
study the master&mdash;that master who touched, without
intention, on the moral of his age when he
painted a miniature of the Blessed Thomas More
on the back of a playing card.</p>

<h3>THE MEN AND WOMEN</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 128px;">
<img src="images/ecill152.png" width="128" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Edward VI.; a type of hat" />
</div>

<p>Here we have a reign which,
from its very shortness, can
hardly be expected to yield
us much in the way of change,
yet it shows, by very slight
movements, that form of growth
which preludes the great changes
to come.</p>

<p>I think I may call a halt here,
and proceed to tell you why
this volume is commenced with
Henry VII., called the Tudor
and Stuart volume, and ends with the Cromwells.
It is because, between these reigns, the tunic
achieves maturity, becomes a doublet, and dies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>275]</a></span>
practically just in the middle of the reign of
Charles II. of pungent memory. The peculiar
garment, or rather, this garment peculiar to a
certain time, runs through its various degrees of
cut. It is, at first, a loose body garment with
skirts; the skirts become arranged in precise folds,
the folds on the skirt are shortened, the shorter
they become the tighter becomes the coat; then
we run through with this coat in its periods of
puffings, slashings, this, that, and the other sleeve,
all coats retaining the small piece of skirt or
basque, and so to the straight, severe Cromwellian
jerkin with the piece of skirt cut into
tabs, until the volume ends, and hey presto!
there marches into history a Persian business&mdash;a
frock coat, straight, trim, quite a near cousin
to our own garment of afternoon ceremony.</p>

<p>For a sign of the times it may be mentioned
that a boy threw his cap at the Host just at the
time of the Elevation.</p>

<p>To Queen Elizabeth has been given the palm
for the wearing of the first silk stockings in
England, but it is known that Sir Thomas Gresham
gave a pair of silk stockings to Edward VI.</p>

<p>We now see a more general appearance in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>276]</a></span>
streets of the flat cap upon the heads of citizens.
The hood, that eminently practical head-gear, took
long to die, and, when at last it went out of fashion,
except among the labouring classes, there came in
the cap that now remains to us in the cap of the
Beefeaters at
the Tower of
London.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 220px;">
<img src="images/ecill153.png" width="220" height="250"
alt="Two men of the time of Edward VI." />
</div>

<p>It is the
time of jerkin
or jacket,
doublet or
coat, and hose&mdash;generally
worn with
trunks, which
were puffed,
short knickerbockers.</p>

<p>The flat cap, afterwards the statute cap as ordered
by Elizabeth, became, as I say, the ordinary head-wear,
though some, no doubt, kept hoods upon
their heavy travelling cloaks. This cap, which some
of the Bluecoat Boys still wear, was enforced upon
the people by Elizabeth for the encouragement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>277]</a></span>
of the English trade of cappers. &lsquo;One cap of
wool, knit, thicked, and dressed in England,&rsquo; was
to be worn by all over six years of age, except
such persons as had &lsquo;twenty marks by year in
lands, and their heirs, and such as have borne office
of worship.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Edward, according to the portraits, always wore
a flat cap, the base of the crown ornamented with
bands of jewels.</p>

<p>The Bluecoat Boys, and long may they have
the sense to keep to their dress, show us exactly
the ordinary dress of the citizen, except that the
modern knickerbocker has taken the place of the
trunks. Also, the long skirts of these blue coats
were, in Edward&rsquo;s time, the mark of the grave
man, others wore these same skirts cut to the
knee.</p>

<p>That peculiar fashion of the previous reign&mdash;the
enormously broad-shouldered appearance&mdash;still
held in this reign to some extent, though the
collars of the jerkins, or, as one may more easily
know them, overcoats or jackets, open garments,
were not so wide, and allowed more of the puffed
shoulder of the sleeve to show. Indeed, the collar
became quite small, as in the Windsor Holbein
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>278]</a></span>
painting of Edward, and the puff in the shoulders
not so rotund.</p>

<p>The doublet of this reign shows no change, but
the collar of the shirt begins to show signs of
the ruff of later years. It is no larger, but is
generally left untied with the ornamental strings
hanging.</p>

<p>Antiquarian research has, as it often does,
muddled us as to the meaning of the word
&lsquo;partlet.&rsquo; Fairholt, who is very good in many
ways, puts down in his glossary, &lsquo;Partlet: A
gorget for women.&rsquo; Then he goes on to say that
a partlet may be goodness knows what else.
Minshein says they are &lsquo;part of a man&rsquo;s attire,
as the loose collar of a doublet, to be set on or
taken off by itself, without the bodies, as the
picadillies now a daies, or as mens&rsquo; bands, or
womens&rsquo; neckerchiefs, which are in some, or at
least have been within memorie, called partlets.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Sir F. Madden says: &lsquo;The partlet evidently
appears to have been the corset or habit-shirt
worn at that period, and which so commonly
occurs in the portraits of the time, generally made
of velvet and ornamented with precious stones.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 378px;">

</div>

<p class="caption">A MAN AND WOMAN OF THE TIME OF
EDWARD VI. (1547-1553)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">The change from the dress of the previous reign
should be easily noticed, especially in the case of the
woman. This dress is, of course, of the plainest in
this time.</p>

<p>Hall, the author of &lsquo;Satires,&rsquo; 1598, speaks of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>279]</a></span>
man, an effeminate dandy, as wearing a partlet
strip. It appears to me, who am unwillingly
forced into judging between so many learned
persons, that, from all I have been able to gather
from contemporary records and papers, the partlet
is indeed, as Minshein says, &lsquo;the loose collar of a
doublet,&rsquo; in reality the same thing as a shirt band.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 318px;">
<img src="images/ecill154.png" width="318" height="300"
alt="Two men of the time of Edward VI." />
</div>

<p>Henry VIII. wore a band about his neck, the
forerunner of the ruff. Some of his bands were
of silver cloth with ruffs to them, others, as I
have shown, were wonderfully embroidered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>280]</a></span>
In this case, then, the partlet is head of the
family tree to our own collar, &lsquo;to be set on or
taken off by itself,&rsquo; and so by way of ruff, valued
at threescore pound price apiece, to plain bands,
to falling bands, laced neckcloth, stock&mdash;to the
nine pennyworth of misery we bolt around our
necks.</p>

<p>Dress, on the whole, is much plainer, sleeves
are not so full of cuts and slashes, and they fit
more closely to the arm. The materials are rich,
but the ornament is not so lavish; the portrait
of Edward by Gwillim Stretes is a good example
of ornament, rich but simple. Shoes are not cut
about at the toe quite with the same splendour,
but are still broad in the toe.</p>

<p>For the women, it may be said that the change
towards simplicity is even more marked. The
very elaborate head-dress, the folded, diamond-shaped
French hood has disappeared almost entirely,
and, for the rich, the half hoop, set back from the
forehead with a piece of velvet or silk to hang
down the back, will best describe the head-gear.
From that to the centre-pointed hoop shows the
trend of the shape. This latest form of woman&rsquo;s
head apparel was born, I think, out of the folds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>281]</a></span>
of the linen cap worn in the house, and this,
being repeated in the velvet night-caps, became
the extreme of fashion. The drawing will show
how the square end of the linen cap, falling in
the centre of the circular cap-shape, cut the semicircle
and overlapped it, thus giving the appearance
later to become exaggerated into a form cut
especially to that shape. (I try to be as lucid
as I can manage, but the difficulties of describing
such evolutions in any but tangled language I
leave the reader to imagine.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 429px;">
<img src="images/ecill155.png" width="429" height="300"
alt="Two women of the time of Edward VI.; two types of head-dress" />
</div>

<p>The women are also wearing cloth hoods, rather
baggy cap-like hoods, with a hanging-piece behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>282]</a></span>
The most notable change is the collar of the
gown, which suddenly springs into existence. It
is a high collar and very open in front, showing
a piece of the under-dress. On this collar is
sewn&mdash;what I shall call&mdash;the woman&rsquo;s partlet, as
the embroidery is often detachable and answers the
same purpose as the man&rsquo;s partlet; this later became
a separate article, and was under-propped with
wires to hold it out stiffly.</p>

<p>The same stiff-bodied appearance holds good,
but in more simple dresses the skirts were not
quite as voluminous as heretofore.</p>

<p>With overcoats in general the hanging sleeve
is being worn, the arm of the wearer coming out
just below the puffed shoulder-piece.</p>

<p>With these remarks we may safely go on to
the reign of Mary; another reign which does not
yield us much in the way of clothes.</p>

<h3>THE MEN AND WOMEN</h3>

<p>I cannot do better than commence this chapter
by taking you back to the evening of August 3,
1553. Mary, with her half-sister Elizabeth, entered
London on this date. At Aldgate she was met
by the Mayor of London, who gave her the City
sword. From the Antiquarian Repertory comes
this account:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;First, the citizens&rsquo; children walked before her
magnificently dressed; after followed gentlemen
habited in velvets of all sorts, some black, others
in white, yellow, violet, and carnation; others
wore satins or taffety, and some damasks of all
colours, having plenty of gold buttons; afterwards
followed the Mayor, with the City Companies, and
the chiefs or masters of the several trades; after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>284]</a></span>
them, the Lords, richly habited, and the most
considerable knights; next came the ladies, married
and single, in the midst of whom was the Queen
herself, mounted on a small white ambling nag,
the housings of which were fringed with gold
thread; about her were six lacqueys, habited in
vests of gold.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Queen herself was dressed in violet velvet,
and was then about forty years of age, and rather
fresh coloured.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Before her were six lords bareheaded, each
carrying in his hand a yellow mace, and some
others bearing the arms and crown. Behind her
followed the archers, as well of the first as the
second guard.</p>

<p>&lsquo;She was followed by her sister, named Madame
Elizabeth, in truth a beautiful Princess, who was
also accompanied by ladies both married and
single.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>In the crowds about the city waiting to stare
at the new Queen as she passed by, one could
recognise the various professions by their colours.
The trained bands in white doublets with the City
arms before and behind; lawyers in black; sheriffs
and aldermen in furred gowns with satin sleeves;
citizens in brown cloaks and workers in cloth or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>285]</a></span>
leather doublets; citizens&rsquo; servants in blue liveries;
gentlemen&rsquo;s servants in very gorgeous liveries of
their masters&rsquo; colours. Here is a description of
a gentleman&rsquo;s page and his clothes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;One doublet of yelow million fustian, th&rsquo;one
halfe buttoned with peche-colour buttons, and
the other half laced downwards; one payer of
peche-colour, laced with smale tawnye lace; a

th&rsquo;cape and down the fore face, twisted with two

set with the said twisted lace and the buttons of
russet silk and gold.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This will give some notion of the elaborate
liveries worn, and also it will show how, having
understood the forms of the garments and the
material which may be used, the rest, ornament
and fancy, depend on the sense of the reader.</p>

A change has come over the streets, the town
is full of Spaniards come over with Philip, and
these bring with them many innovations in dress.
The most noticeable is the high-peaked Spanish
hat, a velvet bag with a narrow brim, worn on
one side of the head. There is,
also, a hard-crowned hat, round
the crown-base of which is a
gold cord clasped by a jewel;
a feather is stuck into this hat.
Yet the mass of citizens wear
the flat cap, some of them, the
older men, have a coif tied
under their chins, and over this
the flat cap. Again, older men
wear black velvet skull caps.</p>

<p>With these Spaniards comes,
also, the first appearance of
the ruff, very neat and small.</p>

<p>Although the overcoats of Henry&rsquo;s and Edward&rsquo;s
reigns still form the principal wear, the short
Spanish cloak has come in, cut in full folds, and
reaching not far below the waist. They also
brought in the cloak with a turned up high collar;
and some had sleeves to their cloaks.</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">The half-way between the dress of 1530 and 1560.
A cloak very much of the period, and a tunic in the
state of evolution towards the doublet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>287]</a></span>
One sees more beards and moustaches, short
clipped beards, and beards with two points.</p>

<p>Shoes are now more to the shape of the foot,
and high boots strapped up over the knee, also
half-boots with the tops turned over to be seen.
Often, where the hose meet the
trunks, these are turned down.</p>

<img src="images/ecill157.png" width="140" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Mary; two types of boot" />
</div>

<p>The doublets become shaped
more closely to the body, all
showing the gradual change
towards the Elizabethan costume,
but still retaining the
characteristics of earlier times,
as the long skirt to the
doublet, and the opening
to show the collar of the shirt,
or partlet strip.</p>

<p>Ladies now show more hair, parted, as before,
in the centre, but now puffed out at the sides.</p>

<p>The new shape of head-dress becomes popular,
and the upstanding collar to the gown is almost
universal.</p>

<p>The gowns themselves, though retaining the
same appearance as before, full skirts, no trains,
big sleeves, and split to show the under-gown,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>288]</a></span>
have the top part of the gown covering the bosom
made of a separate material, as, for instance, a
gown of fine cloth will have collar and yoke of
velvet.</p>

<p>Women wear neat linen caps, made very plain
and close to the head, with small ear-pieces.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 374px;">

</div>

<p>On the shoulders there is a fashion of wearing
kerchiefs of linen or silk, white as a rule; white,
in fact, is frequently used for dresses, both for
men and women.</p>

<p>The custom of carrying small posies of flowers
comes in, and it is interesting to see the Queen,
in her portrait by Antonio More, carrying a bunch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>289]</a></span>
of violets arranged exactly as the penny bunches
sold now in our streets.</p>

<p>There was, in most dresses, a great profusion
of gold buttons, and the wearing of gold chains
was common&mdash;in fact, a gold chain about the
neck for a man, and a gold chain girdle for a
woman, were part of the ordinary everyday dress.</p>

<p>You will realize that to one born in the reign
of Henry VIII. the appearance of people now
was very different, and, to anyone as far away
as we are now, the intervening reigns of Edward
and Mary are interesting as showing the wonderful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>290]</a></span>
quiet change that could take place in those few
years, and alter man&rsquo;s exterior from the appearance
of a playing-card, stiff, square, blob-footed, to the
doublet and hose person with a cart-wheel of a
ruff, which recalls to us Elizabethan dress.</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">The habit of wearing flowers in the opening of the
dress was frequent at this time, was, in fact, begun
about this reign. One can easily see in this dress
the ground-work of the Elizabethan fashion, the
earliest of which was an exaggeration of this costume.</p>

<h3>THE MEN</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 94px;">
<img src="images/ecill160.png" width="94" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Elizabeth" />
</div>

<p>Here we are in the middle of
great discoveries with adventurers,
with Calvin and Michael Angelo,
living and dying, and Galileo and
Shakespeare seeing light&mdash;in the very
centre and heart of these things, and
we and they discussing the relations
of the law to linen. How, they and
we ask, are breeches, and slop-hose
cut in panes, to be lined? In such
writings we are bound to concern
ourselves with the little things that
matter, and in this reign we meet
a hundred little things, little fussy things, the
like of which we leave alone to-day. But this
is not quite true. To-day a man, whether he cares
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>292]</a></span>
to admit it or no, is for ever choosing patterns,
colours, shades, styles to suit his own peculiar personality.
From the cradle to the grave we are
decked with useless ornaments&mdash;bibs, sashes, frills,
little jackets, neat ties, different coloured boots,
clothes of ceremony, clothes supposed to be in
harmony with the country, down, at last, to the
clothes of an old gentleman, keeping a vague
reminder of twenty, thirty years ago in their style,
and then&mdash;grave clothes.</p>

<p>How well we know the Elizabethan! He is a
stock figure in our imagination; he figured in our
first schoolboy romances, he strutted in the first
plays we saw. Because it was an heroic time we
hark back to it to visualize it as best we may so that
we can come nearer to our heroes&mdash;Drake, Raleigh,
and the rest. The very names of the garments
arouse associations&mdash;ruff, trunks, jumper, doublet,
jerkin, cloak, bone-bobbin lace, and lace of Flanders&mdash;they
almost take one&rsquo;s breath away.</p>

<p>Here comes a gentleman in a great ruff, yellow-starched,
an egg-shaped pearl dangles from one ear.
One hand rests on his padded hip, the other holds
a case of toothpicks and a napkin; he is going to
his tavern to dine. His doublet is bellied like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>293]</a></span>
pea&rsquo;s cod, and his breeches are bombasted, his little
hat is stuck on one side and the feather in it curls
over the brim. His doublet is covered with a
herring-bone pattern in silk stitches, and is slashed
all over. He is exaggerated, monstrous; he is tight-laced;
his trunks stick out a foot all round him,
and his walk is, in consequence,
a little affected; but, for all
that, he is a gallant figure.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 133px;">
<img src="images/ecill161.png" width="133" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Elizabeth" />
</div>

<p>Behind him comes a gentleman
in loose knee-breeches
barred with velvet; at the knee
he has a frill of lace. His jerkin
is not stuffed out, and his ruff
is not starched to stick up round
his head. His hair is cut in
three points, one over each ear
and the third over the centre of
his forehead, where we see a twisted lock tied with
ribbon. We seem to know these people well&mdash;very
well. The first, whose clothes are of white
silk sewn with red and blue, whose trunk hose have
clocks of silk sewn on them, reminds us of whom?
And the second gentleman in green and red, with
heels of red on his shoes? Suddenly there flashes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>294]</a></span>
across our memory the picture of a lighted stage, a
row of shops, a policeman, and then a well-known
voice calling, &lsquo;Hello, Joey, here we are again!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Here we are again after all these centuries&mdash;clown
and pantaloon, the rustic with red health on
his face, the old man in Venetian slops&mdash;St. Pantaloone&mdash;just
as Elizabethan, humour included, as
anything can well be.</p>

<p>Then, enter Harlequin in his clothes of gorgeous
patches; the quick, almost invisible thief, the
instigator of all the evil and magic. His patches
and rags have grown to symmetrical pattern, his
loose doublet has become this tight-fitting lizard
skin of flashing gold and colours, but his atmosphere
recalls the great days.</p>

<p>To these enter 1830&mdash;Columbine&mdash;an early Victorian
lady, who contrives to look sweetly modest
in the shortest and frilliest of skirts; she looks like
a rose, a rose on two pink stalks. She, being so
different, gives the picture just the air of magic incongruity.
Once, years ago, she was dressed in
rags like Harlequin, but I suppose that the age of
sentiment clothed her in her ballet costume rather
than see her in her costly tatters.</p>

<p>We are a conservative nation, and we like our own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>295]</a></span>
old jokes so much that we have kept through the
ages this extraordinary pleasing entertainment
straight down, clothes and all, from the days of
Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Even as we dream of this, and the harlequinade
dazzles our eyes, the dream changes&mdash;a new sound
is heard, a sound from the remote past, too. We
listen eagerly, clown, pantaloon, harlequin, and
columbine vanish to the sound of the pan-pipes and
the voice of Punch.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Root-ti-toot, rootity-toot!&rsquo; There, by the
corner of the quiet square, is a tall box covered
with checkered cloth. Above a man&rsquo;s height is an
opening, and on a tiny stage are two figures, one in
a doublet stiffened out like a pea pod, with a ruff
hanging loose about his neck, bands at his wrists,
a cap on his head&mdash;Punch. The other with a linen
cap and a ruff round her neck&mdash;Judy. Below, on
the ground by the gentleman who bangs a drum
and blows on the pan-pipes stuck in his muffler, is
a dog with a ruff round his neck&mdash;Toby. And we
know&mdash;delightful to think of it&mdash;that a box hidden
by the check covering, contains many curiously
dressed figures&mdash;all friends of ours. The world is
certainly curious, and I suppose that an Elizabethan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>296]</a></span>
revisiting us to-day would find but one thing the
same, the humour of the harlequinade and the
Punch and Judy show.</p>

<p>Now let us get to the dull part. If you wish to
swim in a sea of allusions there are a number of
books into which you may dive&mdash;</p>

<p>If you do not come out from these saturated
with detail then you will never absorb anything.</p>

<p>For the shapes, the doublet was a close-fitting
garment, cut, if in the Italian fashion, down to
a long peak in front. They were made without
sleeves, like a waistcoat, and an epaulette overhung
the armhole. The sleeves were tied into the
doublet by means of points (ribbons with metal
tags). These doublets were for a long time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>297]</a></span>
stuffed or bombasted into the form known as
&lsquo;pea&rsquo;s cod bellied&rsquo; or &lsquo;shotten-bellied.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The jerkin was a jacket with sleeves, and was
often worn over the doublet. The sleeves of the
jerkin were often open from shoulder to wrist to
show the doublet sleeve underneath. These sleeves
were very wide, and were ornamented with large
buttons.</p>

</div>

<p>The jornet was a loose travelling cloak.</p>

<p>The jumper a loose jerkin, worn for comfort or
extra clothing in winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>298]</a></span>
Both doublet and jerkin had a little skirt or base.</p>

<p>The very wide breeches known as trunks were
worn by nearly everybody in the early part of the
reign, until they vied with Venetian breeches for
fashion. They were sometimes made of a series of
wide bands of different colours placed alternately;
sometimes they were of bands, showing the stuffed
trunk hose underneath. They were stuffed with
anything that came handy&mdash;wool, rags, or bran&mdash;and
were of such proportions that special seats
were put in the Houses of Parliament for the
gentlemen who wore them. The fashion at its
height appears to have lasted about eight years.</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">He wears a double linen collar, nearly as usual at
this time as the ruff. His trunk hose will be seen
through the openings of his trunks. His boots are
held up by two leather straps. His cloak is an
Italian fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>299]</a></span>
The Venetian breeches were very full at the top
and narrowed to the knee; they were slashed and
puffed, or paned like lattice windows with bars of
coloured stuffs or gold lace.</p>

<p>The French breeches were tight and ruffled in
puffs about the thighs.</p>

<p>The stockings were of yarn, or silk, or wool.
They were gartered about the knee,
and pulled up over the breeches; but
the man most proud of his leg wore
no garters, but depended on the
shape of his leg and the fit of his
stocking to keep the position. These
stockings were sewn with clocks at
the ankles, and had various patterns
on them, sometimes of gold or silver
thread. Openwork stockings were
known.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 88px;">
<img src="images/ecill164.png" width="88" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Elizabeth" />
</div>

<p>The stockings and breeches were
called, if the breeches were short and the stockings
all the way up the leg, trunk hose and trunks; if
the breeches came to the knee and the stockings
just came over them, they were known as upper
stocks and nether stocks.</p>

<p>The shoes were shaped to the foot, and made of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>300]</a></span>
various leathers or stuffs; a rose of ribbon sometimes
decorated the shoes. There were shoes with
high cork soles called moyles. Of course, there
were gallants who did things no one else thought
of doing&mdash;wearing very square-toed shoes, for
instance, or cock feathers in their hair.</p>

<p>The sturtops
were boots to
the ankle.</p>

</div>

<p>As for the
hair, we have
the love-lock
tied with ribbons,
the very
same that we
see caricatured
in the wigs of
clown and pantaloon.
We have, also, hair left fairly long and
brushed straight back from the forehead, and short-cropped
hair. Beards and moustaches are worn by
most.</p>

<p>They wore little cloaks covered with embroidery,
lace, sometimes even with pearls. For winter or for
hard travelling the jornet or loose cloak was worn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>301]</a></span>
The older and more sedate wore long stuff
gowns with hanging sleeves; these gowns, made
to fit at the waist and over the trunks, gave an
absurd Noah&rsquo;s ark-like appearance to the wearers.
Those who cared nothing for the fashions left
their gowns open and wore them
loose.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 84px;">
<img src="images/ecill166.png" width="84" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Elizabeth" />
</div>

<p>The common people wore simple
clothes of the same cut as their lords&mdash;trunks
or loose trousers, long hose,
and plain jerkins or doublets. In the
country the fashions alter, as a rule,
but little; however, in this reign
Corydon goes to meet Sylvia in somewhat
fashionable clothes. Lodge
says: &lsquo;His holiday suit marvellous
seemly, in a russet jacket, welted with
the same, and faced with red worsted,
having a pair of blue camblet sleeves,
bound at the wrists with four yellow laces, closed
before very richly with a dozen pewter buttons.
His hose of gray kersey, with a large slop barred
all across the pocket holes with three fair guards,
stitched on either side with red thread.&rsquo; His
stockings are also gray kersey, tied with different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>302]</a></span>
coloured laces; his bonnet is green, and has a
copper brooch with the picture of St. Dennis.
&lsquo;And to want nothing that might make him
amorous in his old days, he had a fair shirt-band
of white lockeram, whipt over with Coventry blue
of no small cost.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 315px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>303]</a></span>
The hats worn vary in shape from steeple-crowned,
narrow-brimmed hats, to flat, broad-crowned
hats; others show the coming tendency
towards the broad-brimmed Jacobean hat. Round
these hats were hatbands of every sort, gold chains,
ruffled lace, silk or wool.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 442px;">
<img src="images/ecill168.png" width="442" height="300"
alt="Five types of hat for men" />
</div>

<p>I think we may let these gallants rest now to
walk among the shades&mdash;a walking geography of
clothes they are, with French doublets, German
hose, Spanish hats and cloaks, Italian ruffs, Flemish
shoes; and these with chalked faces, fuzzed periwigs
of false hair, partlet strips, wood busks to
keep straight slim waists, will make the shades
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>304]</a></span>
laugh perhaps, or perhaps only sigh, for there are
many in that dim wardrobe of fashions who are
still more foolish, still more false, than these
Elizabethans.</p>


<h3>THE WOMEN</h3>

<p>Now this is the reign of the ruff and the monstrous
hoop and the wired hair. As a companion to her
lord, who came from the hands of his barber with
his hair after the Italian manner, short and round
and curled in front and frizzed, or like a Spaniard,
long hair at his ears curled at the two ends, or
with a French love-lock dangling down his
shoulders, she&mdash;his lady&mdash;sits under the hands of
her maid, and tries various attires of false <em>hair</em>,
principally of a yellow colour. Every now and
again she consults the looking-glass hanging on
her girdle; sometimes she dresses her hair with
chains of gold, from which jewels or gold-work
tassels hang; sometimes she, too, allows a love-lock
to rest upon her shoulder, or fall negligently
on her ruff.</p>

<p>Even the country girl eagerly waits for news
of the town fashions, and follows them as best she
may.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>305]</a></span>
In the early part of the reign the simple costume
of the previous reign was still worn, and even the
court ladies were quietly, though richly, dressed.</p>

<p>In the first two years the ruff remained a fairly
small size, and was made of holland, which remained
stiff, and held the folds well; but later,
there entered several Dutch ladies, headed by Mistress
Dingham Vander Plasse, of Flanders, in 1564,
who taught her pupils the art of starching cambric,
and the art of folding, cutting, and pinching ruffs
at five pounds a head, and the art of making starch,
at the price of one pound.</p>

<p>First, the lady put on her underpropper of wire
and holland, and then she would place with a
great nicety her ruff of lace, or linen, or cambric.
One must understand that the ruff may be great or
small, that only the very fashionable wore such a
ruff as required an underpropper, and that the
starched circular ruff would stand by itself without
the other appliance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 401px;">
<img src="images/ecill169.png" width="401" height="550"
alt="Twelve types of head-dress and collar or ruff for women" />
</div>

<p>Before the advent of the heavily-jewelled and
embroidered stomacher, and the enormous spread
of skirt, the dress was a modification of that worn
by the ladies in the time of Henry VIII. First, a
gown cut square across the bosom and low over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>306]</a></span>
the shoulders, full sleeves ending in bands of cambric
over the hands (these sleeves slit to show puffs
of cambric from the elbow to the wrist), the skirt full
and long, but without any train; the whole fitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>307]</a></span>
well to the figure as far as the waist, and very
stiff in front. Over this a second gown, generally
of plain material, split above in a <img src="images/v.png" width="13" height="15" alt="V" />-shape, split
below at the waist, and cut away to show the
under-gown. The sleeves of this gown were wide,
and were turned back or cut away just by the
elbow. Both gowns were laced up the back.
This second gown had, as a rule, a high, standing
collar, which was lined with some rich silk or with
lace.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 277px;">

alt="Four women of the time of Elizabeth" />
</div>

<p>This shape gave way to a more exaggerated
form, and finally to many varieties of exaggeration.
The lady might wear a jerkin like in shape to a
man&rsquo;s, except that often it was cut low and square
over the bosom, and was not stuffed quite so much
in front; every variety of rich material was used
for this jerkin, and the sleeves were as varied as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>308]</a></span>
were the man&rsquo;s, split and tied with ribbons.
False sleeves attached at the shoulders, and left
to hang loose, puffed, slashed all over, with or
without bands of cambric or lace at the wrists;
these bands sometimes were frills, sometimes stiffened
and turned back. No person except royalty
might wear crimson except in under-garments, and
the middle class were not allowed to wear velvet
except for sleeves.</p>

<p>This jerkin was sometimes worn buttoned up,
like a man&rsquo;s, to the neck, and when the hoops came
into fashion and were worn high up near the waist,
the basque or flounce at the bottom of the jerkin
was made long, and pleated full to the top of
the hooped petticoat.</p>

<p>The plainer fashion of this was a gown buttoned
high&mdash;up to the ruff&mdash;and opened from the waist
to the feet to show a full petticoat of rich material;
this was the general wear of the more sober-minded.</p>

<p>Sometimes a cape was worn over the head and
shoulders, not a shaped cape, but a plain, oblong
piece of stuff. The ladies sometimes wore the shaped
cape, with the high collar that the men wore. The
French hood with a short liripipe was worn by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>309]</a></span>
country ladies; this covered the hair, showing
nothing but a neat parting in front.</p>

<p>The openwork lace bonnet, of the shape so well
known by the portraits of Queen Mary of Scotland,
is not possible to exactly describe in writing;
one variety of it may be seen in the line drawing
given. It is made of cambric and cut lace sewn on
to wires bent
into the shape
required.</p>

</div>

<p>In such a
time of extravagance
in
fashion the
additions one
may make to
any form of
dress in the
way of ribbons, bows, sewn pearls, cuts, slashes,
and puffs are without number, and I can only give
the structure on which such ornamental fripperies
can be placed. The hair, for example, can be
dressed with pearls, rings of gold, strings of pearls,
feathers, or glass ornaments. Men and women
wore monstrous earrings, but curiously enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>310]</a></span>
this fashion was more common to men than
women. Hats were interchangeable, more especially
the trim hat with a feather, in shape like those
worn by the Yeoman of the Guard, but smaller.</p>

<p>The shoulder pinions of the jerkins were puffed,
slashed, and beribboned in every way. The wing
sleeves, open from the shoulder all the way down,
were so long sometimes as to reach the ground,
and were left hanging in front, or thrown back
over the shoulders, the better to display the rich
under-sleeve.</p>

<p>The ladies&rsquo; shoes were cork-soled, high-heeled,
and round-toed. The girdles were of every stuff,
from gold cord, curiously knotted, to twisted silk;
from these hung looking-glasses, and in them were
stuck the embroidered and scented gloves.</p>

<p>Ladies went masked about the streets and in the
theatres, or if they wished to be unconventional,
they sat in the playing booths unmasked, their
painted faces exposed to the public gaze.</p>

<p>The shoes with the high cork soles, to which
I have just alluded, were in common use all over
Europe, and were of all heights&mdash;from two inches
to seven or eight&mdash;and they were called <i>chopines</i>.
They were not such a foolish custom as might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>311]</a></span>
appear, for they protected the wearer from the
appalling filth of the streets. The tall chopines
that Hamlet mentions were really very high-soled
slippers, into which the richly-embroidered shoes
were placed to protect them when the ladies
walked abroad. The shoes were made of leather
and velvet stitched with silk, embroidered with
gold, or stamped with patterns, slashed sometimes,
and sometimes laced with coloured silk laces.</p>

<p>Some ladies wore bombazines, or a silk and
cotton stuff made at Norwich, and bone lace made
at Honiton, both at that time the newest of English
goods, although before made in Flanders; and they
imported Italian lace and Venetian shoes, stuffed
their stomachers with bombast, and wore a frontlet
on their French hoods, called a <i>bongrace</i>, to keep
their faces from sunburn.</p>

<p>Cambric they brought from Cambrai in France,
and calico from Calicut in India&mdash;the world was
hunted high and low for spoil to deck these
gorgeous, stiff, buckramed people, so that under all
this load of universal goods one might hardly hope
to find more than a clothes prop; in fact, one might
more easily imagine the overdressed figure to be a
marvellous marionette than a decent Englishwoman.</p>

</div>

<p>Falstaff will
not wear coarse
dowlas shirts,
dandies call for
ostrich feathers,
ladies must have
Coventry blue
gowns and
Italian flag-shaped
fans;
everybody is in
the fashion from
milkmaids to ladies of the court, each as best as they
may manage it. The Jew moves about the streets
in his long gaberdine and yellow cap, the lady pads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>313]</a></span>
about her garden in tall chopines, and the gentleman
sits down as well as he may in his bombasted
breeches and smokes Herbe de la Reine in a pipe
of clay, and the country woman walks along in
her stamell red petticoat guarded or strapped with
black, or rides past to market in her over-guard
skirts.</p>

<p>Let us imagine, by way of a picture of the
times, the Queen in her bedchamber under the
hands of her tiring-women: She is sitting before
a mirror in her embroidered chemise of fine Raynes
linen, in her under-linen petticoat and her silk
stockings with the gold thread clocks. Over these
she wears a rich wrap. Slippers are on her feet.
In front of her, on a table, are rouge and chalk
and a pad of cotton-wool&mdash;already she has made
up her face, and her bright bird-like eyes shine in a
painted mask, her strong face, her hawk-like nose and
her expressionless mouth reflect back at her from
the mirror. Beside the rouge pot is a Nuremberg
egg watch, quietly ticking in its crystal case.
One of the women brings forward a number of
attires of false hair, golden and red, and from
these the Queen chooses one. It is a close periwig
of tight red curls, among which pearls and pieces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>314]</a></span>
of burnished metal shine. With great care this
wig is fastened on to the Queen&rsquo;s head, and she
watches the process with her bright eyes and
still features in the great mirror.</p>

<p>Then, when this wig is fixed to her mind, she
rises, and is helped into the privie coat of bones
and buckram, which is laced tightly by the women
at her back. Now comes the moment when they
are about to fasten on her whalebone hips the
great farthingale&mdash;over which her voluminous
petticoats and skirts will fall. The wheel of
bone is tied with ribbons about her waist, and
there securely fastened. After some delay in
choosing an under-gown, she then puts on several
linen petticoats, one over another, to give the
required fulness to her figure; and then comes
the stiffly-embroidered under-gown&mdash;in this case
but a petticoat with a linen bodice which has no
sleeves.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF ELIZABETH (1558-1603)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">Compare this with the other plate showing the
opposite fashion.</p>

<p>With great care she seats herself on a broad
chair, and a perfect army of ruffs is laid before
her. As the tire-woman is displaying the ruffs
she talks to the Queen, and tells her that peculiar
story, then current, of the Lady of Antwerp, who
was in a great way because she could not get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>315]</a></span>
her ruff to set aright, and when in a passion she
called upon the devil to take it, as if in answer
to the summons a young and handsome gentleman
appeared. Together they tried the ruff, and the
young gentleman suddenly strangled the lady and
vanished. Now when they came to carry away
the coffin of the lady some days later, it was
found that no one could lift it, so, in the end, it
was opened, and there, to the surprise of everybody,
sat a great black cat setting a ruff. The
Queen&rsquo;s eyes twinkle on this story, for she has
a great fund of dry humour&mdash;and so, to the
business of the ruffs. First one and then another
is discarded; and finally the choice falls between
one of great size, shaped like a catherine-wheel
and starched blue, and the other of three depths
but not of such great circumference, starched
yellow, after the receipt of Mrs. Turner, afterwards
hung at Tyburn in a ruff of the same colour.</p>

<p>The Queen wavers, and the tire-woman recommends
the smaller bands: &lsquo;This, madame, is one
of those ruffs made by Mr. Higgins, the tailor
near to St. James&rsquo;s, where he has set up an
establishment for the making of such affairs&mdash;it
is a picadillie, and would&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>316]</a></span>
The Queen stops her and chooses the ruff; it
is very much purled into folds, and it bristles with
points.</p>

<p>The women approach with a crimson over-gown
and slips it over the Queen&rsquo;s head&mdash;it is open in
front to show the rich petticoat, and it has great
stuffed wings, epaulettes, or mahoitres on the
shoulders. The tight-fitting bodice of the gown
is buttoned up to the throat, and is stuffed out
in front to meet the fall of the hoops; it has
falling sleeves, but the real sleeves are now brought
and tied to the points attached to the shoulders
of the gown. They are puffed sleeves of the
same material as the under-gown, and the falling
sleeves of the upper gown are now tied with one
or two bows across them so that the effect of
the sleeves is much the same as the effect of the
skirts; an embroidered stuff showing in the opening
of a plain material. These are called virago
sleeves.</p>

<p>This done, the strings of pearls are placed
around the Queen&rsquo;s neck, and then the underpropper
or supportasse of wire and holland is
fastened on her neck, and the picadillie ruff laid
over it. The Queen exchanges her slippers for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>317]</a></span>
cork-soled shoes, stands while her girdle is knotted,
sees that the looking-glass, fan, and pomander
are hung upon it, and then, after a final survey
of herself in the glass, she calls for her muckinder
or handkerchief, and&mdash;Queen Elizabeth is dressed.</p>

<p>So in this manner the Queen struts down to
posterity, a wonderful woman in ridiculous clothes,
and in her train we may dimly see Mr. Higgins,
the tailor, who named a street without knowing
it, a street known in every part of the civilized
world; but, nowadays, one hardly thinks of connecting
Piccadilly with a lace ruff....</p>


<h3>SHAKESPEARE AND CLOTHES</h3>

<p>There are not so many allusions to Elizabethan
dress in the plays of Shakespeare as one might
suppose upon first thought. One has grown so
accustomed to Shakespeare put on the stage in
elaborate dresses that one imagines, or one is apt
to imagine, that there is a warrant for some of the
dresses in the plays. In some cases he confounds
the producer and the illustrator by introducing
garments of his own date into historical plays, as,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>318]</a></span>
for example, Coriolanus. Here are the clothes
allusions in that play:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;When you cast your stinking greasy caps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have made good work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You and your apron-men.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Go to them with this bonnet in your hand.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Enter Coriolanus in a gown of humility.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Matrons fling gloves, ladies and maids their scarfs and
handkerchers.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;The kitchen malkin pins her richest lockram<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> &rsquo;bout her
reechy neck.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Our veiled dames.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Commit the war of white and damask in their nicely
gawded cheeks to the wanton and spoil of Ph&oelig;bus&rsquo; burning
kisses.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Doublets that hangmen would bury with these that wore
them.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>I have not kept the lines in verse, but in a convenient
way to show their allusions.</p>

<p>In &lsquo;Pericles&rsquo; we have mention of ruffs and bases.
Pericles says:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;I am provided of a pair of bases.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Certainly the bases might be made to appear
Roman, if one accepts the long slips of cloth or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>319]</a></span>
leather in Roman military dress as being bases;
but Shakespeare is really&mdash;as in the case of the
ruffs&mdash;alluding to the petticoats of the doublet of
his time worn by grave persons. Bases also apply
to silk hose.</p>

<p>In &lsquo;Titus Andronicus&rsquo; we have:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;An idiot holds his bauble for his God.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Julius C&aelig;sar is mentioned as an Elizabethan:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;He plucked ope his doublet.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Carpenter in &lsquo;Julius C&aelig;sar&rsquo; is asked:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The mob have &lsquo;sweaty night-caps.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Cleopatra, in &lsquo;Antony and Cleopatra,&rsquo; says:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give thee an armour all of gold.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The &lsquo;Winter&rsquo;s Tale,&rsquo; the action of which occurs
in Pagan times, is full of anachronisms. As, for
instance, Whitsun pastorals, Christian burial, an
Emperor of Russia, and an Italian fifteenth-century
painter. Also:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Lawn as white as driven snow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cyprus<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> black as ere was crow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gloves as sweet as damask roses;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Masks for faces and for noses;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>320]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Bugle-bracelet, necklace amber,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perfume for a lady&rsquo;s chamber;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Golden quoifs and stomachers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pins and polking-sticks of steel.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>So, you see, Autolycus, the pedlar of these early
times, is spoken of as carrying polking-sticks with
which to stiffen ruffs.</p>

<p>Shylock, in &lsquo;The Merchant of Venice,&rsquo; should
wear an orange-tawny bonnet lined with black
taffeta, for in this way were the Jews of Venice
distinguished in 1581.</p>

<p>In &lsquo;The Tempest&rsquo; one may hear of rye-straw
hats, of gaberdines, rapiers, and a pied fool&rsquo;s
costume.</p>

<p>In &lsquo;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&rsquo; we hear:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;No, girl; I&rsquo;ll tie it up in silken strings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With twenty odd conceited true-love knot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be fantastic may become a youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of greater time than I shall show to be.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Also:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Since she did neglect her looking-glass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And threw her sun-expelling mask away.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many ladies at this time wore velvet masks.
&lsquo;The Merry Wives of Windsor&rsquo; gives us a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>321]</a></span>
thrummed hat, a muffler or linen to hide part of
the face, gloves, fans. Falstaff says:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;When Mistress Bridget lost the handle of her fan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I took it up my honour thou had&rsquo;st it not.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Also:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;The firm fashion of thy foot would give an excellent
motion to thy fait in a semicircled farthingale.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&lsquo;Twelfth Night&rsquo; is celebrated for us by Malvolio&rsquo;s
cross garters. Sir Toby, who considers his
clothes good enough to drink in, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;So be these boots too: an they be not, let them hang
themselves in their own straps.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Sir Toby also remarks to Sir Andrew upon the
excellent constitution of his leg, and Sir Andrew
replied that:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;It does indifferent well in a flame-coloured stock.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Clown says:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;A sentence is but a cheveril<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> glove to a good wit.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In &lsquo;Much Ado About Nothing&rsquo; we learn of one
who lies awake ten nights, &lsquo;carving the fashion of
his doublet.&rsquo; Also of one who is</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;in the shape of two countries at once, as a German from
the waist downwards all slops, and a Spaniard from the hip
upward, no doublet.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>322]</a></span>
Again of a gown:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;Cloth of gold, and cuts, and laced with silver set with
pearls down sides, side sleeves, and skirts, round under borne
with a bluish tinsel.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>In &lsquo;As You Like It&rsquo; one may show a careless
desolation by ungartered hose, unbanded bonnet,
unbuttoned sleeve, and untied shoe.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Taming of the Shrew&rsquo; tells of serving-men:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;In their new fustian and their white jackets.... Let
their blue coats be brushed, and their garters of an indifferent
knit.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Also we have a cap &lsquo;moulded on a porringer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost&rsquo; tells of:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;Your hat penthouse-like o&rsquo;er the shop of your eyes;
with your arms crossed on your thin belly doublet like a
rabbit on a spit; or your hands in your pocket like a man
after the old painting.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&lsquo;All&rsquo;s Well that Ends Well&rsquo;:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;Why dost thou garter up thy arms o&rsquo; this fashion?
Dost make a hose of thy sleeves?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yonder&rsquo;s my lord your son with a patch of velvet on&rsquo;s
face: whether there be a scar under&rsquo;t or no, the velvet
knows.... There&rsquo;s a dozen of &rsquo;em, with delicate fine hats
and most courteous feathers, which bow the head and nod at
every man.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>323]</a></span>
In &lsquo;Henry IV.,&rsquo; Part II., there is an allusion
to the blue dress of Beadles. Also:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;About the satin for my short cloak and slops.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes,
and bunches of keys at their girdles.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;To take notice how many pair of silk stockings thou
hast, or to bear the inventory of thy shirts.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>There are small and unimportant remarks upon
dress in other plays, as dancing-shoes in &lsquo;Romeo
and Juliet&rsquo; and in &lsquo;Henry VIII.&rsquo;:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;The remains of fool and feather that they got in France.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&lsquo;Tennis and tall stockings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short blistered breeches and those types of travel.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But in &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; we find more allusions than in
the rest. Hamlet is ever before us in his black:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor customary suits of solemn black.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No hat upon his head; his stockings fouled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ungartered, and down-goes to his ancle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale as his shirt.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;Your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you
last, by the altitude of a chopine.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>&lsquo;O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated
fellow tear a passion into tatters.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>324]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;With two provincial roses on my ragged shoes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sea-gown scarfed about me.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Having read this, I think it will be seen that
there is no such great difficulty in costuming any
play, except perhaps this last. There have been
many attempts to put &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; into the clothes
of the date of his story, but even when the rest
of the characters are dressed in skins and cross-gartered
trousers, when the Viking element is
strongly insisted upon, still there remains the absolutely
Elizabethan figure in inky black, with his
very Elizabethan thoughts, the central figure,
almost the great symbol of his age.</p>

<p>This couplet may give a little sketch of the man
we should now see before us:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;His ruffe is set, his head set in his ruff;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His reverend trunks become him well enough.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>We are still in the times of the upstanding ruff;
we are watching, like sartorial gardeners, for the
droop of this linen flower. Presently this pride of
man, and of woman too, will lose its bristling,
super-starched air, and will hang down about the
necks of the cavaliers; indeed, if we look very
carefully, we see towards the end of the reign the
first fruits of elegance born out of Elizabethan
precision.</p>

<p>Now in such a matter lies the difficulty of presenting
an age or a reign in an isolated chapter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>326]</a></span>
In the first place, one must endeavour to show how
a Carolean gentleman, meeting a man in the street,
might say immediately, &lsquo;Here comes one who still
affects Jacobean clothes.&rsquo; Or how an Elizabethan
lady might come to life, and, meeting the same
man, might exclaim, &lsquo;Ah! these are evidently
the new fashions.&rsquo; The Carolean gentleman would
notice at first a certain air of stiffness, a certain
padded arrangement, a stiff hat, a crisp ornament
of feathers. He would see that the doublet varied
from his own in being more slashed, or slashed in
many more degrees. He would see that it was
stiffened into an artificial figure, that the little
skirt of it was very orderly, that the cut of the
sleeves was tight. He would notice also that the
man&rsquo;s hair was only half long, giving an appearance
not of being grown long for beauty, but
merely that it had not been cut for some time.
He would be struck with the preciseness, the correct
air of the man. He would see, unless the
stranger happened to be an exquisite fellow, that
his shoes were plain, that the &lsquo;roses&rsquo; on them were
small and neat. His trunks, he would observe,
were wide and full, but stiff. Mind you, he would
be regarding this man with seventeenth-century
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>327]</a></span>
eyes&mdash;eyes which told him that he was himself an
elegant, careless fellow, dressed in the best of taste
and comfort&mdash;eyes which showed him that the
Jacobean was a nice enough person in his dress,
but old-fashioned, grandfatherly.</p>

<p>To us, meeting the pair of them, I am afraid
that a certain notion we possess nowadays of cleanliness
and such habits would oppress us in the company
of both, despite the fact that they changed
their linen on Sundays, or were supposed to do so.
And we, in our absurd clothes, with hard hats on
our heads, and stiff collars tight about our necks,
creases in our trousers, and some patent invention
of the devil on our feet, might feel that the Jacobean
gentleman looked and was untidy, to say the
least of it, and had better be viewed from a distance.</p>

<p>To the Elizabethan lady the case would be reversed.
The man would show her that the fashions
for men had been modified since her day; she
would see that his hair was not kept in, what she
would consider, order; she would see that his ruff
was smaller, and his hat brim was larger. She
would, I venture to think, disapprove of him,
thinking that he did not look so &lsquo;smart.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>328]</a></span>
For ourselves, I think we should distinguish
him at once as a man who wore very large knickerbockers
tied at the knee, and, in looking at a
company of men of this time, we should be struck
by the padding of these garments to a preposterous
size.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 332px;">
<img src="images/ecill174.png" width="332" height="250"
alt="Three men of the time of James I.; three types of shoe; one type of boot" />
</div>

<p>There has come into fashion a form of ruff cut
square in front and tied under the chin, which can
be seen in the drawings better than it can be
described; indeed, the alterations in clothes are
not easy to describe, except that they follow the
general movement towards looseness. The trunks
have become less like pumpkins and more like
loose, wide bags. The hats, some of them stiff and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>329]</a></span>
hard, show in other forms an inclination to slouch.
Doublets are often made loose, and little sets of
slashes appear inside the elbow of the sleeves, which
will presently become one long slash in Cavalier
costumes.</p>

<p>We have still:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Morisco gowns, Barbarian sleeves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Polonian shoes, with divers far fetcht trifles;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as the wandering English galant rifles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange countries for.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But we have not, for all that, the wild extravaganza
of fashions that marked the foregoing
reign. Indeed, says another writer, giving us a
neat picture of a man:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&lsquo;His doublet is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So close and pent as if he feared one prison<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would not be strong enough to keep his soul in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his taylor makes another;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trust me (for I knew it when I loved Cupid)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He does endure much pain for poor praise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a neat fitting suit.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>To wear something abnormally tight seems to
be the condition of the world in love, from James I.
to David Copperfield.</p>

<p>Naturally, a man of the time might be riding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>330]</a></span>
down the street across a Scotch plaid saddle
cloth and pass by a beggar dressed in clothes of
Henry VIII.&rsquo;s time, or pass a friend looking truly
Elizabethan&mdash;but he would
find generally that the short,
swollen trunks were very little
worn, and also&mdash;another point&mdash;that
a number of men had
taken to walking in boots,
tall boots, instead of shoes.</p>

<img src="images/ecill175.png" width="133" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of James I.; a variation of breeches" />
</div>

<p>As he rides along in his
velvet cloak, his puffed and
slashed doublet, his silken
hose, his hands gloved with
embroidered gloves, or bared
to show his rings, smelling of
scents, a chain about his neck, he will hear the
many street cries about him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;Will you buy any sand, mistress?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Brooms, brooms for old shoes! Pouch-rings, boots, or
buskings! Will ye buy any new brooms?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;New oysters, new oysters! New, new cockles!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Fresh herrings, cockels nye!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Will you buy any straw?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hay yee any kitchen stuff, maids?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pippins fine! Cherrie ripe, ripe, ripe!&rsquo;</p>

<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF JAMES I. (1603-1625)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">He shows the merging of the Elizabethan fashion
into the fashion of Charles I. The stiff doublet and
the loose breeches, the plain collar, and the ribbons
at the knees. On his hawking glove is a hawk,
hooded and jessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>331]</a></span></p>

alt="Four men of the time of James I.; the bottom of a doublet;

</div>

<p>And he will pass apprentices, most of them still
in flat caps, blue doublets, and white cloth breeches
and stockings, sewn all in one piece, with daggers
on their backs or at their sides. And then, travelling
with his man, he will come to his inn. For
the life of me, though it has little to do with dress,
I must give this picture of an inn from Fynes
Moryson, which will do no harm, despite the fact
that Sir Walter Besant quoted some of it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;As soon as a passenger comes to an Inn, the servants run
to him&rsquo; (these would be in doublet and hose of some plain
colour, with shirt-collars to the doublets turned down loose;
the trunks would be wide and to the knee, and there buttoned),
&lsquo;and one takes his horse and walks him till he be cool, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>332]</a></span>
rubs him and gives him meat, yet I must say that they are
not much to be trusted in this last point, without the eye of
the Master or his servant to oversee them. Another servant
gives the passenger his private chamber, and kindles his fire,
the third pulls off his boots and makes them clean&rsquo; (these
two servants would be wearing aprons). &lsquo;Then the Host or
Hostess visits him, and if he will eat with the Host, or at a
common table with the others, his meal will cost him sixpence,
or in some places but fourpence, yet this course is less
honourable and not used by Gentlemen; but if he will eat
in his chamber&rsquo; (he will retain his hat within the house), &lsquo;he
commands what meats he will according to his appetite, and
as much as he thinks fit for him and his company, yea, the
kitchen is open to him, to command the meat to be dressed
as he likes best; and when he sits at table, the Host or
Hostess will accompany him, if they have many guests, will
at least visit him, taking it for courtesy to be bid sit down;
while he eats, if he have company especially, he shall be
offered music, which he may freely take or refuse, and if he
be solitary the musicians will give him good day with music
in the morning.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is the custom and in no way disgraceful to set up part
of supper for his breakfast.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lastly, a Man cannot more freely command at home in
his own house than he may do in his Inn, and at parting if
he give some few pence to the Chamberlin and Ostler they
wish him a happy journey.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Beyond this and the drawings I need say no
more.</p>

<p>The drawings will show how the points of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>333]</a></span>
doublet may be varied, the
epaulette left or taken away,
the little skirts cut or left
plain. They show you how
a hat may be feathered and
the correct shape of the hat;
how breeches may be left
loose at the knee, or tied, or
buttoned; of the frills at the
wrist and the ruffs at the
neck&mdash;of everything, I hope,
that is necessary and useful.</p>

<h3>THE WOMEN</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;What fashion will make a woman have the best body,
tailor?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A short Dutch waist, with a round Catherine-wheel
fardingale, a close sleeve, with a cartoose collar, or a
pickadell.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>I think, with a little imagination, we can see the
lady: add to our picture a feather fan, a man&rsquo;s
beaver hat with a fine band round it stuck with a
rose or a feather, shoes with ribbons or roses, and
jewels in the hair&mdash;and I think the lady walks.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>334]</a></span>
Yet so difficult do I find it to lead her tripping out
of the wardrobe into the world, I would remind
myself of the laws for servants in this time:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;And no servant may toy with the maids under pain of
fourpence.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>It is a salutary warning, and one that must be
kept in the mind&rsquo;s eye, and as I pluck the lady
from the old print, hold her
by the Dutch waist, and twirl
her round until the Catherine-wheel
fardingale is a blurred
circle, and the pickadell a mist
of white linen, I feel, for my
prying, like one who has toyed
under pain of fourpence.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 205px;">
<img src="images/ecill178.png" width="205" height="250"
alt="High collar and head-dress for a woman" />
</div>

<p>There are many excellent
people with the true historical mind who would
pick up my lady and strip her in so passionless
a way as to leave her but a mass of Latin names&mdash;so
many bones, tissues, and nerves&mdash;and who
would then label and classify her wardrobe under
so many old English and French, Dutch and
Spanish names, bringing to bear weighty arguments
several pages long over the derivation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>335]</a></span>
the word &lsquo;cartoose&rsquo; or &lsquo;pickadell,&rsquo; write in notebooks
of her little secret fineries, bear down on one
another with thundering eloquence upon the relation
of St. Catherine and her wheel upon seventeenth-century
dressmaking, and so confuse and
bewilder the more simple and less learned folk that
we should turn away from the Eve of the seventeenth
century and from the heap of clothes upon
the floor no whit the wiser for all their pains.</p>

<p>Not that I would laugh, even smile, at the diligence
of these learned men who in their day
puzzled the father of Tristram Shandy over the
question of breeches, but, as it is in my mind impossible
to disassociate the clothes and the woman,
I find it difficult to follow their dissertations, however
enlightening, upon Early English cross-stitch.
And now, after I have said all this, I find myself
doing very nearly the same thing.</p>

<p>You will find, if you look into the lady&rsquo;s wardrobe,
that she has other fashions than the close
sleeve: she has a close sleeve as an under sleeve,
with a long hanging sleeve falling from the elbow;
she has ruffs at her wrist of pointed lace, more
cuffs than ruffs, indeed. She does not always follow
the fashion of the short Dutch waist as she has, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>336]</a></span>
can see, a dress with a long waist and a tapering
front to the bodice. Some dresses of hers are
divided in the skirts to show a barred petticoat, or
a petticoat with a broad border of embroidery.
Sometimes she is covered with little bows, and at
others with much gold lacing; and now and again
she wears a narrow sash round her waist tied with
a bow in front.</p>

<p>She is taking more readily to the man&rsquo;s hat,
feathered and banded, and in so doing is forced
to dress her hair more simply and do away with
jewellery on her forehead; but, as is often the
case, she dresses her hair with plumes and jewels
and little linen or lace ruffs, and atop of all wears
a linen cap with side wings to it and a peak in the
centre.</p>

<p>Her ruff is now, most generally, in the form of
an upstanding collar to her dress, open in front,
finishing on her shoulders with some neat bow or
other ornament. It is of lace of very fine workmanship,
edged plain and square, or in all manner
of fancy scallops, circles, and points.</p>

<p>Sometimes she will wear both ruff and collar,
the ruff underneath to prop up her collar at the
back to the required modish angle. Sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>337]</a></span>
her bodice will finish off in a double Catherine-wheel.</p>

<p>Her maid is a deal more simple; her hair is
dressed very plainly, a loop by the ears, a twist
at the nape of the neck. She has a shawl over her
shoulders, or a broad falling collar of white linen.
She has no fardingale, but her skirts are full. Her
bodice fits, but is
not stiffened artificially;
her sleeves
are tight and neat,
and her cuffs plain.
Upon her head is
a broad-brimmed
plain hat.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 287px;">
<img src="images/ecill179.png" width="287" height="250"
alt="Comparison of head-dress between a lady and a maid" />
</div>

<p>She has a piece
of gossip for her
mistress: at Chelsea they are making a satin dress
for the Princess of Wales from Chinese silkworm&rsquo;s
silk. On another day comes the news that the Constable
of Castile when at Whitehall subscribed very
handsomely to the English fashion, and kissed the
Queen&rsquo;s hands and the cheeks of twenty ladies of
honour.</p>

<p>The fashion for dresses of pure white, either in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>338]</a></span>
silk, cloth, or velvet has affected both men and
women; and the countries which gave a name to
the cuts of the garments are evidenced in the
literature of the time. How a man&rsquo;s breeches or
slops are Spanish; his waist, like the lady&rsquo;s, Dutch;
his doublet French; his and her sleeves and wings
on the shoulders French; their boots Polonian,
cloaks German, hose Venetian, hats from everywhere.
These spruce coxcombs, with looking-glasses
set in their tobacco boxes, so that they
may privately confer with them to see&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;How his band jumpeth with his piccadilly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether his band-strings balence equally,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which way his feather wags,&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>strut along on their high-heeled shoes, and ogle
any lady as she passes.</p>

<p>Another fashion common to those in the high
mode was to have the bodice below the ruff cut so
low as to show all the breast bare, and this, together
with the painting of the face, gave great
offence to the more sober-minded.</p>

<p>The ruffs and collars of lace were starched in
many colours&mdash;purple, goose-green, red and blue,
yellow being completely out of the fashion since
the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury by Mrs. Anne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>339]</a></span>
Turner, the friend of the Countess of Somerset;
and this because Mrs. Turner elected to appear at
the gallows in a yellow ruff.</p>

<p class="caption">A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF JAMES I. (1603-1625)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">Here is seen the wide fardingale, or farthingale, the
elaborate under-skirt, and the long hanging sleeves
of the gown. Also, the very tall upstanding ruff or
collar of lace.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 207px;">
<img src="images/ecill180.png" width="207" height="275"
alt="A woman of the time of James I.; a ruff and hat; an alternative dress" />
</div>

<p>As for the fardingale, it was having its last fling.
This absurd garment had its uses once&mdash;so they
say who write scandal of a Spanish Princess, and
served to conceal her
state upon a certain
time; but when ladies
forsook the fashion,
they wore a loose, almost
shapeless, gown,
open from the waist
to the feet, and a plain,
unstiffened jerkin or
jacket underneath.</p>

<p>Such a conglomeration
is needed (if you
remember we are looking
over a lady&rsquo;s wardrobe) to make a lady of
the time: such stuffs as rash, taffeta paropa,
novats, shagge, filizetta, damask, mochado. Rash
is silk and stuff, taffeta is thin silk, mochado
is mock velvet. There, again, one may fall into an
antiquarian trap; whereas mochado is a manufacture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>340]</a></span>
of silk to imitate velvet, mokkadoe is a woollen
cloth, and so on; there is no end to it. Still, some
may read and ask themselves what is a rebatoe.
It is the collar-like ruff worn at this time. In this
medley of things we shall see purles, falles, squares,
buskes, tires, fans, palisadoes (this is a wire to hold
the hair next to the first or duchess knot), puffs,
ruffs, partlets, frislets, fillets, pendulets, bracelets,
busk-points, shoe-ties, shoe roses, bongrace bonnets,
and whalebone wheels&mdash;Eve!</p>

<p>All this, for what purpose? To turn out one
of those extraordinary creatures with a cart-wheel
round the middle of their persons.</p>

<p>As the reign died, so did its fashions die also:
padded breeches lost some of their bombast, ruffs
much of their starch, and fardingales much of
their circumference, and the lady became more
Elizabethan in appearance, wore a roll under her
hair in front, and a small hood with a jewelled
frontlet on her forehead. It was the last of the
Tudor dress, and came, as the last flicker of a
candle, before the new mode, Fashion&rsquo;s next
footstep.</p>

<h3>THE MEN</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 124px;">
<img src="images/ecill181.png" width="124" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Charles I." />
</div>

<p>This surely is the age of
elegance, if one may trust
such an elegant and graceful
mind as had Vandyck. In all
the wonderful gallery of portraits
he has left, these silvery
graceful people pose in garments
of ease.</p>

<p>The main thing that I must
do is to show how, gradually,
the stiff Jacobean dress became
unfrozen from its clutch
upon the human form, how
whalebones in men&rsquo;s jackets melted away, breeches
no longer swelled themselves with rags and bran,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>342]</a></span>
collars fell down, and shirts lounged through great
open spaces in the sleeves.</p>

<p>It was the time of an immaculate carelessness;
the hair was free, or seemed free, to droop in
languid tresses on men&rsquo;s shoulders, curl at pretty
will on men&rsquo;s foreheads. Shirts were left open at
the neck, breeches were loosed at the knee. Do
I revile the time if I say that the men had an
air, a certain supercilious air, of being dukes disguised
as art students?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 397px;">
<img src="images/ecill182.png" width="397" height="250"
alt="Six styles of hair and beard" />
</div>

<p>We know, all of us, the Vandyck beard, the
Carolean moustache brushed away from the lips;
we know Lord Pembroke&rsquo;s tousled&mdash;carefully
tousled&mdash;hair; Kiligrew&rsquo;s elegant locks.</p>

<p>From the head to the neck is but a step&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>343]</a></span>
sad step in this reign&mdash;and here we find our friend
the ruff utterly tamed; &lsquo;pickadillies, now out of
request,&rsquo; writes one, tamed into the falling band,
the Vandyck collar, which form of neck-dress has
never left the necks and shoulders of our modern
youthful prodigies; indeed, at one time, no youthful
genius dare be without one. The variations of
this collar are too well known; of such lace as
edged them and of
the manner of their
tying, it would waste
time to tell, except
that in some instances
the strings
are secured by a ring.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 269px;">
<img src="images/ecill183.png" width="269" height="200"
alt="A doublet" />
</div>

<p>Such a change has
come over the doublet as to make it hardly the same
garment; the little slashes have become two or three
wide cuts, the sleeves are wide and loose with, as a
rule, one big opening on the inside of the arm, with
this opening embroidered round. The cuffs are like
little collars, turned back with point-lace edges.
The actual cut of the doublet has not altered a
great deal, the ordinary run of doublet has the
pointed front, it is tied round the waist with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>344]</a></span>
little narrow sash; but there has arrived a new
jacket, cut round, left open from the middle of
the breast, sometimes cut so short as to show the
shirt below bulged out over the breeches. Sometimes
you will see one of these new short jackets
with a slit in the back, and under this the man
will be wearing the round trunks of his father&rsquo;s
time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;">
<img src="images/ecill184.png" width="392" height="300"
alt="Two men of the time of Charles I.; a type of jacket; a type of breeches" />
</div>

<p>The breeches are mostly in two classes&mdash;the
long breeches the shape of bellows, tied at the
knee with a number of points or a bunch of
coloured ribbons; or the breeches cut the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>345]</a></span>
width all the way down, loose at the knee and
there ornamented with a row of points (ribbons
tied in bows with tags on them).</p>

<p>A new method of ornamentation was this notion
of coloured ribbons in bunches, on the breeches,
in front, at the sides, at the knees&mdash;almost anywhere&mdash;and
also upon the coats.</p>

<p>For some time the older fashioned short round
cape or cloak prevailed, but later, large silk cloaks
used as wraps thrown across the shoulders were
used as well. The other cloaks had straps, like
the modern golf cape, by which the cloak might
be allowed to fall from the shoulders.</p>

<p>A custom arrived of wearing boots more
frequently, and there was the tall, square-toed,
high-heeled boot, fitting up the leg to just below
the knee, without a turnover; the stiff, thick
leather, blacking boot with broad, stiff tops, also
not turned back; and there was also the result
of the extraordinary melting, crumpled dismissal
of all previous stiffness, whereby the old tall boot
drooped down until it turned over and fell into
a wide cup, all creases and wrinkles, nearly over
the foot, while across the instep was a wide, shaped
flap of leather. This last falling boot-top was

turned in all manner of ways by those who cared

<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF CHARLES I. (1625-1649)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">He has wrapped his blue cloak over his arm, a usual
method of carrying the cloak. He is simply dressed,
without bunches of ribbons or points.</p>

<p>The insides of the tops of these boots were
lined with lace or silk, and the dandy turned
them down to give full show to the lining&mdash;this
turning of broad tops was such an inconvenience
that he was forced to use a straddled walk when
he wore his boots thus.</p>

<p>Canes were carried with gold, silver, or bone
heads, and were ornamented further by bunches
of ribbon.</p>

<p>Coming again to the head, we find ribbon also
in use to tie up locks of hair; delicate shades of
ribbon belonging to some fair lady were used to
tie up locks to show delicate shades of love.
Some men wore two long love-locks on either
side of the face, others wore two elaborately-curled
locks on one side only.</p>

<p>The hats, as the drawings will show, are broad
in the brim and of an average height in the crown,
but a dandy, here and there, wore a hat with next
to no brim and a high crown. Most hats were
feathered.</p>

<p>There is a washing tally in existence of this
time belonging, I think, to the Duke of Rutland,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>348]</a></span>
which is very interesting. It is made of beech-wood
covered with linen, and is divided into
fifteen squares. In the centre of each square there
is a circle cut, and in the circle are numbers. Over
the number is a plate with a pin for pivot in the
centre, a handle to turn, and a hole to expose a
number. Above each circle are the names of the
articles in this order:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Order of washing tally">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Ruffs.</td>
    <td class="tdl">Bandes.</td>
    <td class="tdl">Cuffes.</td>
    <td class="tdl">Handkercher.</td>
    <td class="tdl">Cappes.</td>

    <td class="tdl">Table Clothes.</td>
    <td class="tdl">Napkins.</td>
    <td class="tdl">Towells.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Topps are linen boot-frills, and halfshirts are
stomachers.</p>

<p>There remains little to be said except that black
was a favourite dress for men, also light blue and
cream-coloured satin. Bristol paste diamonds were
in great demand, and turquoise rings were very
fashionable.</p>

<p>For the rest, Vandyck&rsquo;s pictures are available
to most people, or good reproductions of them,
and those, with a knowledge of how such dress
came into being, are all that can be needed.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>349]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE WOMEN</h3>

<p>There is one new thing you must be prepared
to meet in this reign, and that will best be described
by quoting the title of a book written at
this time: &lsquo;A Wonder of Wonders, or a Metamorphosis
of Fair Faces into Foul Visages; an
invective against black-spotted faces.&rsquo;</p>

<p>By this you may see at once that every humour
was let loose in the shapes of stars, and moons,
crowns, slashes, lozenges, and even a coach and
horses, cut in black silk, ready to be gummed to
the faces of the fair.</p>

<p>Knowing from other histories of such fads that
the germ of the matter lies in a royal indisposition,
we look in vain for the conceited history of the
Princess and the Pimple, but no doubt some more
earnest enquirer after truth will hit upon the story&mdash;this
toy tragedy of the dressing-table.</p>

<p>For the dress we can do no better than look
at the &lsquo;Ornatus Muliebris Anglicanus,&rsquo; that wonderfully
careful compilation by Hollar of all the
dresses in every class of society.</p>

<p>It is interesting to see how the Jacobean
costume lost, by degrees, its formal stiffness, and
first fardingale and then ruff vanished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>350]</a></span>
Early in the reign the high-dressed hair was
abandoned, and to take its place the hair was
dressed so that it was gathered up by the ears,
left parted on the crown, and twisted at the back
to hold a plume or feather. Time went on, and
hair-dressing again altered; the hair was now
taken in four parts: first the hair was drawn well
back off the forehead, then the two side divisions
were curled neatly and dressed to fall over the
ears, the fourth group of hair was neatly twisted
and so made into a small knot holding the front
hair in its place. Later on came the fringe of
small curls, as in the portrait of Queen Henrietta
at Windsor by Vandyck.</p>

<p>We see at first that while the ruff, or rather
the rebatoe&mdash;that starched lace high collar&mdash;remained,
the fardingale having disappeared,
left, for the upper gown, an enormous quantity
of waste loose material that had previously
been stretched over the fardingale and parted in
front to show the satin petticoat. From this
there sprung, firstly, a wide, loose gown, open
all the way down and tied about the middle with
a narrow sash, the opening showing the boned
bodice of the under-dress with its pointed protruding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>351]</a></span>
stomacher, the woman&rsquo;s fashion having retained
the form of the man&rsquo;s jerkin. Below this showed
the satin petticoat with its centre strip or band
of embroidery, and the wide border of the same.
In many cases the long hanging sleeves were kept.</p>

<p>Then there came the fall of the rebatoe and
the decline of the protruding figure, and with
this the notion of tying back the full upper skirt
to show more plainly the satin petticoat, which
was now losing the centre band of ornament and
the border.</p>

<p>With this revolution in dress the disappearing
ruff became at first much lower and then finally
vanished, and a lace collar, falling over the
shoulders, took its place. This gave rise to two
distinct fashions in collars, the one as I have
described, the other a collar from the neck, like
a large edition of the man&rsquo;s collar of that time.
This collar came over the shoulders and in two
points over the breast, sometimes completely hiding
the upper part of the dress.</p>

<p>The stiff-boned bodice gave place to one more
easily cut, shorter, with, in place of the long
point, a series of long strips, each strip ornamented
round the hem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>352]</a></span>
At this time the sleeves, different from the
old-fashioned tight sleeves, were very full indeed,
and the sleeve of the loose over-gown was made
wider in proportion, and was tied across the
under-sleeve above the elbow by a knot of ribbons,
the whole ending in a deep cuff of lace. Then
the over-gown disappeared, the bodice became a
short jacket laced in front, openly, so as to show
the sleeveless bodice of the same material and
colour as the petticoat; the sleeves were not made
so wide, and they were cut to come just below
the elbow, leaving the wrists and forearm bare.</p>

<p>In winter a lady often wore one of those loose
Dutch jackets, round and full, with sleeves just
long enough to cover the under-sleeves, the whole
lined and edged with fur; or she might wear a
short circular fur-lined cape with a small turned-over
collar. In summer the little jacket was often
discarded, and the dress was cut very simply but
very low in the bust, and they wore those
voluminous silk wraps in common with the men.</p>

<p>The little sashes were very much worn, and ornaments
of knots of ribbon or points (that is, a ribbon
with a metal tag at either end) were universal.</p>

<p>The change of fashion to short full sleeves gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>353]</a></span>
rise to the turned back cuff of the same material
as the sleeve, and some costumes show this short
jacket with its short sleeves with cuffs, while under
it shows the dress with tight sleeves reaching to
the wrists where were linen or lace cuffs, a combination
of two fashions.</p>

<p>Part of the lady&rsquo;s equipment now was a big
feather fan, and a big fur muff for winter; also the
fashion of wearing long gloves to reach to the
elbow came in with the advent of short sleeves.</p>

<p>Naturally enough there was every variety of
evolution from the old fashion to the new, as
the tight sleeves did not, of course, become
immediately wide and loose, but by some common
movement, so curious in the history of such
revolutions, the sleeve grew and grew from puffs
at the elbow to wide cuffs, to wide shoulders,
until the entire sleeve became swollen out of all
proportion, and the last little pieces of tightness
were removed.</p>

<p>The form of dress with cuffs to the jackets,
lacing, sashes, bunches of ribbon, and looped up
skirts, lasted for a great number of years. It
was started by the death of the fardingale, and
it lived into the age of hoops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>354]</a></span>
These ladies wore shoe-roses upon their shoes,
and these bunches of ribbon, very artificially made
up, cost sometimes as much as from three to
thirty pounds a pair, these very expensive roses
being ornamented with jewels. From these we
derive the saying, &lsquo;Roses worth a family.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In the country the women wore red, gray, and
black cloth homespun, and for riding they put
on safeguards or outer petticoats. The wide-brimmed
beaver hat was in general wear, and a
lady riding in the country would wear such a
hat or a hood and a cloak and soft top boots.</p>

<p>Women&rsquo;s petticoats were called plackets as well
as petticoats.</p>

<p>With the careless air that was then adopted
by everybody, which was to grow yet more carefully
careless in the reign of Charles II., the hair
was a matter which must have undivided attention,
and centuries of tight dressing had not
improved many heads, so that when the loose
love-locks and the dainty tendrils became the
fashion, many good ladies and gentlemen had
recourse to the wigmaker. From this time until
but an hundred years ago, from the periwig
bought for Sexton, the fool of Henry VIII., down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>355]</a></span>
to the scratches and bobs of one&rsquo;s grandfather&rsquo;s
youth, the wigmaker lived and prospered. To-day,
more secretly yet more surely, does the maker of
transformations live and prosper, but in the days
when to be wigless was to be undressed the
perruquier was a very great person.</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">Notice the broad collar and deep cuffs. The dress
is simple but rich. The bodice is laced with the
same colour as the narrow sash. The hair is arranged
in a series of elaborate curls over the forehead.</p>

<p>This was the day, then, of satins, loosened hair,
elbow sleeves, and little forehead curls. The
stiffness of the older times will pass away, but
it had left its clutch still on these ladies; how far
it vanished, how entirely it left costume, will be
seen in the next royal reign, when Nell Gwynne
was favourite and Sir Peter Lely painted her.</p>

<p>It is a question, in this time of restraint, of
formalism, where anything could be made plain,
cut in a cumbrous fashion, rendered inelegant,
it was done. The little jackets were denuded of
all forms of frippery, the breeches were cut straight,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>360]</a></span>
and the ornaments, if any, were of the most severe
order. Hats became broader in the brim, boots
wider in the tops, in fact, big boots seemed almost
a sign of heavy religious feeling. The nice hair,
love-locks, ordered negligence all vanished, and
plain crops or straight hair, not
over long, marked these extraordinary
people. It was a natural
revolt against extravagance, and
in some more sensible minds it
was not carried to excess; points
and bows were allowable, though
of sombre colours. Sashes still
held good, but of larger size,
ruffs at the wrists were worn,
but of plain linen. The bands
or collars varied in size according
to the religious enthusiasm of the
wearers, but all were plain without
lace edgings, and were tied
with plain strings. Black, dark brown, and dull
gray were the common colours, relieved sometimes,
if the man was wearing a sleeveless coat,
by the yellow and red-barred sleeves of the under-jacket,
or possibly by coloured sleeves sewn into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>361]</a></span>
the coat under the shoulder-wings. Overcoats
were cut as simply as possible, though they did
not skimp the material but made them wide and
loose.</p>

<p>The women dressed their hair more plainly,
the less serious retained the little bunches of side
curls, but the others smoothed their hair away
under linen caps or black hoods tied under their
chins. Another thing the women did was to cut
from their bodices all the little strips but the one
in the middle of the back, and this they left, like
a tail, behind. Some, of course, dressed as before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>362]</a></span>
with the difference in colour and in ornament
that made for severity. It had an effect on the
country insomuch as the country people ceased
to be extravagant in the materials for garments
and in many like ways, and so lay by good fortunes
for their families&mdash;these families coming later into
the gay court of
Charles II. had all
the more to lavish
on the follies of his
fashions.</p>

could draw you a

has become part of the stock for an Academy

he has a book in his hand, laughing maids bring
him jacks of ale, jeering Cavaliers swagger past

<p>The Puritaness is also known. She is generally

collar are shown to hide a merry-eyed lady, her

up skirt,
linen cap,
her little
flaunt of
curls show
her still mischievous.
The pair of
them, in
reality religious
fanatics,
prepared a
harvest that they little dreamt of&mdash;a harvest of
extravagant clothes and extravagant manners, when
the country broke loose from its false bondage of

dresses and enormous periwigs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>364]</a></span>
In the next reign you will see an entirely new
era of clothes&mdash;the doublet and jerkin, the trunks
and ruffs have their last eccentric fling, they
become caricatures of themselves, they do all the
foolish things garments can do, and then, all
of a sudden, they vanish&mdash;never to be taken up
again. Hair, long-neglected, is to have its full
sway, wigs are the note for two centuries, so
utterly different did the man become in the short
space of thirty-five years, that the buck of the
Restoration and the beau of the Jacobean order
would stare helplessly at each other, wondering
each to himself what manner of fool this was
standing before him.</p>

</div>

<p>England, apparently
with a sigh
of relief, lays aside
her hair shirt, and
proves that she has
been wearing a silk
vest under it. Ribbon-makers and
wig-makers, lace-makers,
tailors, and
shoemakers, pour
out thankful offerings at the altar of Fashion.
One kind of folly has replaced another; it is only
the same goddess in different clothes. The lamp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>366]</a></span>
that winked and flickered before the stern black
figure in Geneva bands and prim curls is put to
shame by the flare of a thousand candles shining
on the painted face, the exposed bosom, the
flaunting love-locks of this Carolean deity.</p>

</div>

<p>We have burst out into periwigs, monstrous,
bushy; we have donned petticoat breeches ruffled
like a pigeon; we have cut our coats till they
are mere apologies, serving to show off our fine
shirts; and we have done the like with our coat-sleeves,
leaving a little cuff glittering with buttons,
and above that we have cut
a great slit, all to show the
marvel of our linen.</p>

<p>Those of us who still
wear the long wide breeches
adorn them with heavy
frills of deep lace, and sew
bunches of ribbons along
the seams. We tie our
cravats in long, stiff bows or knot them tight,
and allow the wide lace ends to float gracefully.</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">This shows the dress during the first half of the
reign. The feature of groups of ribboning is shown,
with the short sleeve, the full shirt, and the petticoat.</p>

<p>Our hats, broad-brimmed and stiff, are loaded
with feathers; our little cloaks are barred with
silk and lace and gold cord; our shoes are square-toed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>367]</a></span>
and high-heeled, and are tied with a long-ended
bow of ribbon.</p>

</div>

<p>Ribbon reigns triumphant: it ties our periwigs
into bunches at the ends; it hangs in loops round
our waists; it ties our shirt-sleeves up in several
places; it twists itself round our knees. It is on
our hats and heads, and
necks and arms, and legs
and shoes, and it peers out
of the tops of our boots.
Divines rave, moralists
rush into print, to no purpose.
The names seem to
convey a sense of luxury:
dove-coloured silk brocade,
Rhingrave breeches,
white lutestring seamed
all over with scarlet and
silver lace, sleeves whipt
with a point lace, coat trimmed and figured with
silver twist or satin ribbon; canvas, camblet, galloon
and shamey, vellam buttons and taffety ribbons.
The cannons, those bunches of ribbons round our
knees, and the confidents, those bunches of curls by
our ladies&rsquo; cheeks, do not shake at the thunderings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>368]</a></span>
of Mr. Baxter or other moral gentlemen who
regard a Maypole as a stinking idol. Mr. Hall
writes on &lsquo;The Loathsomeness of Long Hair,&rsquo;
Mr. Prynne on &lsquo;The Unloveliness of Lovelocks,&rsquo;
and we do not care a pinch of rappe.</p>

<p>Little moustaches and tiny lip beards grow
under careful treatment, and the ladies wear a
solar system in patches on their cheeks.</p>

<p>The ladies soon escaped the bondage of the
broad Puritan collars, and all these had hid was
exposed. The sleeves left the arms bare to the
elbow, and, being slit above and joined loosely
by ribbons, showed the arm nearly to the shoulder.
The sleeves of these dresses also followed the
masculine fashion of little cuffs and tied-up linen
under-sleeves. The bodices came to a peak in
front and were round behind. The skirts were
full, satin being favoured, and when held up
showed a satin petticoat with a long train. The
ladies, for a time, indulged in a peculiar loop of
hair on their foreheads, called a &lsquo;fore-top,&rsquo; which
gave rise to another fashion, less common, called
a &lsquo;taure,&rsquo; or bull&rsquo;s head, being an arrangement of
hair on the forehead resembling the close curls
of a bull. The loose curls on the forehead were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>369]</a></span>
called &lsquo;favorites&rsquo;; the long locks arranged to hang
away from the face over the ears were called &lsquo;heart-breakers&rsquo;;
and the curls close to
the cheek were called &lsquo;confidents.&rsquo;
Ladies wore cloaks with
baggy hoods for travelling, and
for the Mall the same hats as
men, loaded with feathers.</p>

<p>I am going to leave the change
in dress during this reign to the
next chapter, in which you will
read how it struck
Mr. Pepys. This
change separates the
old world of dress
from the new; it is the advent of
frocked coats, the ancestor of our frock-coat.
It finishes completely the series
of evolutions beginning with the old
tunic, running through the gown stages
to the doublet of Elizabethan times,
lives in the half coat, half doublet of
Charles I., and ends in the absurd little
jackets of Charles II., who, sartorially, steps from
the end of the Middle Ages into the New Ages,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>370]</a></span>
closes the door on a wardrobe of brilliant eccentricity,
and opens a cupboard containing our first
frock-coat.</p>


<h3>PEPYS AND CLOTHES</h3>

<p>It is not really necessary for me to remind the
reader that one of the best companions in the world,
Samuel Pepys, was the son of a tailor. Possibly&mdash;I
say possibly because the argument is really absurd&mdash;he
may have inherited his great interest in clothes
from his father. You see where the argument leads
in the end: that all men to take an interest in
clothes must be born tailors&rsquo; sons. This is no more
true of Adam, who certainly did interest himself,
than it is of myself.</p>

<p>Pepys was educated at St. Paul&rsquo;s School, went
to Trinity College, Cambridge, got drunk there,
and took a scholarship. He married when he was
twenty-two a girl of fifteen, the daughter of a
Huguenot. He was born in 1633, three years
after the birth of Charles II., of outrageous
but delightful memory, and he commenced his
Diary in 1660, the year in which Charles entered
London, ending it in 1669, owing to his increasing
weakness of sight. He was made Secretary to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>371]</a></span>
Admiralty in 1672, in 1673 he became a member
of Parliament, was sent to the Tower as a Papist
in 1679, and released in 1680. In 1684 he became
President of the Royal Society, and he died in
1703, and is buried in St. Olave&rsquo;s, Crutched Friars.</p>

<p>Pepys mentions, in 1660, his coat with long
skirts, fur cap, and buckles on his shoes. The
coat was, doubtless, an old-fashioned Cromwellian
coat with no waist.</p>

<p>Later he goes to see Mr. Calthrop, and wears
his white suit with silver lace, having left off his
great skirt-coat. He leaves Mr. Calthrop to lay
up his money and change his shoes and stockings.</p>

<p>He mentions his scarlet waistclothes, presumably
a sash, and regards Mr. John Pickering as an ass
because of his feathers and his new suit made at
the Hague. He mentions his linning stockings
and wide cannons. This mention of wide cannons
leads me to suppose that at this time any ornament
at the knee would be called cannons, whether it
was a part of the breeches or the stockings, or a
separate frill or bunch of ribbons to put on.</p>

<p>On July 1, still in the same year, comes home
his fine camlett cloak and gold buttons; also a
silk suit. Later he buys a jackanapes coat with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>372]</a></span>
silver buttons. Then he and Mr. Pin, the tailor,
agree upon a velvet coat and cap (&lsquo;the first I ever
had&rsquo;). He buys short black stockings to wear over
silk ones for mourning.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 216px;">
<img src="images/ecill195.png" width="216" height="250"
alt="Two women of the time of Charles II." />
</div>

<p>On October 7 he says that, long cloaks being out
of fashion, he must get a short one. He speaks of
a suit made in France for My Lord costing &pound;200.
He mentions ladies&rsquo; masks.</p>

<p>In 1662 his wife has a pair of peruques of hair
and a new-fashioned petticoat of sancenett with
black, broad lace.
Smocks are mentioned,
and linen
petticoats.</p>

<p>He has a riding-suit
with close knees.</p>

<p>His new lace band
is so neat that he is
resolved they shall
be his great expense.
He wears a scallop.
In 1663 he has a new
black cloth suit, with white linings under all&mdash;as
the fashion is&mdash;to appear under the breeches.</p>

covered with feathers.</p>

<img src="images/ecill196.png" width="99" height="350"
alt="Three types of wig for men" />
</div>

<p>God willing, he will begin next week to wear his
three-pound periwig.</p>

<p>He has spent last month (October) &pound;12 on Miss
Pepys, and &pound;55 on his clothes. He has silk tops
for his legs and a new shag gown.
He has a close-bodied coat, light-coloured
cloth with a gold edge.
He sees Lady Castlemaine in yellow
satin with a pinner on.</p>

<p>In 1664 his wife begins to wear
light-coloured locks.</p>

<p>In 1665 there is a new fashion
for ladies of yellow bird&rsquo;s-eye hood.
There is a fear of the hair of periwigs
during the Plague. Even in the
middle of the Plague Pepys ponders
on the next fashion.</p>

<p>In 1666 women begin to wear
buttoned-up riding-coats, hats and
periwigs.</p>

<p>On October 8 the King says he will
set a thrifty fashion in clothes. At this momentous
date in history we must break for a minute from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>374]</a></span>
our friend Pepys, and hear how this came about.
Evelyn had given the King his pamphlet entitled
&lsquo;Tyrannus, or the
Mode.&rsquo; The King reads
the pamphlet, and is
struck with the idea
of the Persian coat.
A long pause may be
made here, in which
the reader may float
on a mental cloud back
into the dim ages in
the East, and there
behold a transmogrified
edition of his own frock-coat
gracing the back
of some staid philosopher. Evelyn had also
published &lsquo;Mundus Muliebris; or, the Ladies&rsquo;
Dressing-Room Unlocked.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 196px;">
<img src="images/ecill197.png" width="196" height="300"
alt="A woman of the time of Charles II." />
</div>

<p>So, only one month after the Great Fire of
London, only a short time before the Dutch burnt
ships in the Medway, only a year after the Plague,
King Charles decides to reform the fashion. By
October 13 the new vests are made, and the King
and the Duke of York try them on. On the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>375]</a></span>
fifteenth the King wears his in public, and says he
will never change to another fashion. &lsquo;It is,&rsquo; says
Pepys, &lsquo;a long cassocke close to the
body, of black cloth and pinked with
white silk under it, and a coat over
it, and the legs ruffled with black
ribband like a pigeon&rsquo;s legs.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 103px;">
<img src="images/ecill198.png" width="103" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of Charles II." />
</div>

<p>The ladies, to make an alteration,
are to wear short skirts. Nell
Gwynne had a neat ankle, so I imagine
she had a hand in this fashion.</p>

<p>On October 17 the King, seeing
Lord St. Alban in an all black suit,
says that the black and white makes them look
too much like magpies. He bespeaks one of all
black velvet.</p>

<p>Sir Philip Howard increases in the Eastern
fashion, and wears a nightgown and a turban like
a Turk.</p>

<p>On November 2 Pepys buys a vest like the
King&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>On November 22 the King of France, Louis XIV.,
who had declared war against England earlier in the
year, says that he will dress all his footmen in vests
like the King of England. However, fashion is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>376]</a></span>
beyond the power of royal command, and the
world soon followed in the matter of the Persian
coat and vest, even to the present
day.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 106px;">
<img src="images/ecill199.png" width="106" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of Charles II." />
</div>

<p>Next year, 1667, Pepys notes that
Lady Newcastle, in her velvet cap
and her hair about her ears, is the
talk of the town. She wears a
number of black patches because of
the pimples about her mouth, she is
naked-necked (no great peculiarity),
and she wears a <i>just au corps</i>, which
is a close body-coat.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 117px;">
<img src="images/ecill200.png" width="117" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of Charles II." />
</div>

<p>Pepys notices the shepherd at
Epsom with his wool-knit stockings
of two colours, mixed. He
wears a new camlett cloak. The
shoe-strings have given place to
buckles, and children wear long
coats.</p>

<p>In 1668 his wife wears a flower
tabby suit (&lsquo;everybody in love with
it&rsquo;). He is forced to lend the Duke of York
his cloak because it rains. His barber agrees to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>377]</a></span>
keep his periwig in order for &pound;1 a year. He buys
a black bombazin suit.</p>

<p>In 1669 his wife wears the new French gown
called a sac; he pays 55s. for his new belt. His
wife still wears her old flower tabby gown. So
ends the dress note in the Diary.</p>

alt="Two men of the time of James II.; a type of sleeve" />
</div>

<p>In such a short space
of time as this reign
occupies it is not
possible to show any
great difference in
the character of the
dress, but there is a
tendency, shown over
the country at large,
to discard the earlier
beribboned fashions,
and to take more seriously to the long coat and
waistcoat. There is a tendency, even, to become
more buttoned up&mdash;to present what I can only call
a frock-coat figure. The coat became closer to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>379]</a></span>
body, and was braided across the front in many
rows, the ends fringed out and held by buttons.
The waistcoat, with the pockets an arm&rsquo;s length
down, was cut the same length as the coat.
Breeches were more frequently cut tighter, and
were buttoned up the side of the leg. The cuffs
of the sleeves were wide, and were turned back
well over the wrist.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 296px;">

</div>

<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF JAMES II. (1685-1689)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">The body-coat has now become the universal fashion,
as have also the wide knee-breeches. Buckles are
used on the shoes instead of strings.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 115px;">
<img src="images/ecill202.png" width="115" height="250"

<p>Of course the change was gradual, and more
men wore the transitional coat than the tight one.
By the coat in its changing stages
I mean such a coat as this: the
short coat of the early Charles II.
period made long, and, following
the old lines of cut, correspondingly
loose. The sleeves remained much
the same, well over the elbow,
showing the white shirt full and
tied with ribbons. The shoe-strings
had nearly died out, giving
place to a buckle placed on a strap
well over the instep.</p>

<p>There is a hint of growth in the periwig, and of
fewer feathers round the brim of the hat; indeed,
little low hats with broad brims, merely ornamented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>380]</a></span>
with a bunch or so of ribbons, began to become
fashionable.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/ecill203.png" width="125" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of James II." />
</div>

<p>Swords were carried in broad baldricks richly
ornamented.</p>

<p>The waistclothes of Mr. Pepys would, by now,
have grown into broad sashes, with heavily fringed
ends, and would be worn round the outside coat;
for riding, this appears to have been the fashion,
together with small peaked caps, like jockey caps,
and high boots.</p>

<p>The ladies of this reign simplified the dress into
a gown more tight to the bust, the sleeves more
like the men&rsquo;s, the skirt still very
full, but not quite so long in the train.</p>

<p>Black hoods with or without
capes were worn, and wide collars
coming over the shoulders again
came into fashion. The pinner,
noticed by Pepys, was often worn.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 362px;">

<img src="images/ecpl58.jpg" width="362" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF JAMES II. (1685-1689)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">Notice the broad collar again in use, also the
nosegay. The sleeves are more in the mannish
fashion.</p>

<p>But the most noticeable
change occurs in the dress of
countryfolk and ordinary citizens.
The men began to drop all forms of doublet, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>381]</a></span>
take to the long coat, a suit of black grogram below
the knees, a sash, and a walking-stick; for the cold,
a short black cloak. In the country the change
would be very noticeable. The country town, the
countryside, was, until a few years back, distinctly
Puritanical in garb; there were Elizabethan doublets
on old men, and wide Cromwellian breeches,
patched doubtless, walked the market-place. Hair
was worn short. Now the russet brown clothes
take a decided character in the direction of the
Persian coat and knickerbockers closed at the knee.
The good-wife of the farmer knots a
loose cloth over her head, and pops a
broad-brimmed man&rsquo;s hat over it. She
has the sleeves of her dress made with
turned-back cuffs, like her husband&rsquo;s,
ties her shoes with strings, laces her
dress in front, so as to show a bright-coloured
under-bodice, and, as like as
not, wears a green pinner (an apron with
bib, which was pinned on to the dress),
and altogether brings herself up to date.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 85px;">
<img src="images/ecill204.png" width="85" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of James II." />
</div>

<p>One might see the farmer&rsquo;s wife riding to market
with her eggs in a basket covered with a corner of
her red cloak, and many a red cloak would she meet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>382]</a></span>
on the way to clep with on the times and the
fashions. The green apron was a mark of a Quaker
in America, and the Society of Friends was not by
any means sad in colour until late in their history.</p>

<p>Most notable was the neckcloth in this unhappy
reign, which went by the name of Judge Jeffreys&rsquo;
hempen cravat.</p>

Periwig, peruke, campaign wig

heads loaded with curl upon
curl, long ringlets hanging

scented hair, almost hiding the

<p>My fine gentleman walking the street with the
square-cut coat open to show a fine waistcoat, his
stick hanging by a ribbon on to his wrist and rattling
on the pavement as it dragged along, his hat carefully
perched on his wig, the crown made wide and
high to hold the two wings of curls, which formed
a negligent central parting. His pockets, low down
in his coat, show a lace kerchief half dropping from
one of them. One hand is in a small muff, the
other holds a fine silver-gilt box filled with Vigo
snuff. He wears high-heeled shoes, red heeled,
perhaps, and the tongue of
his shoe sticks up well above
the instep. Probably he is on
his way to the theatre, where
he will comb his periwig in
public, and puff away the
clouds of powder that come
from it. The fair lady in a
side box, who hides her face
behind a mask, is delighted
if Sir Beau will bow to her.</p>

<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF WILLIAM AND
MARY (1689-1702)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">Strings again in use on the shoes. Cuffs much
broader; wigs more full; skirts wider. Coat left
open to show the long waistcoat.</p>

<p>We are now among most
precise people. One must walk here with just
such an air of artificiality as will account one a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>385]</a></span>
fellow of high tone. The more enormous is our
wig, the more frequently we take a pinch of Violet
Strasburg or Best Brazil, Orangery, Bergamotte, or
Jassamena, the more shall we be followed by persons
anxious to learn the fashion. We may even draw
a little silver bowl from our pocket, place it on
a seat by us, and, in meditative mood, spit therein.</p>

<p>We have gone completely into skirted coats and
big flapped waistcoats; we have adopted the big
cuff buttoned back; we have given up altogether
the wide knee-breeches, and wear only breeches not
tight to the leg, but just full enough for comfort.</p>

<p>The hats have altered considerably now; they are
cocked up at all angles, turned off the forehead,
turned up one side, turned up all round; some are
fringed with gold or silver lace, others are crowned
with feathers.</p>

<p>We hear of such a number of claret-coloured suits
that we must imagine that colour to be all the rage,
and, in contrast to other times not long gone by,
we must stiffen ourselves in buckram-lined skirts.</p>

<p>These powdered Absaloms could change themselves
into very fine fighting creatures, and look twice
as sober again when occasion demanded. They
rode about the country in periwigs, certainly, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>386]</a></span>
not quite so bushy and curled; many of them
took to the travelling or campaign wig with
the dildos or pole-locks. These
wigs were full over the ears
and at the sides of the forehead,
but they were low in the
crown, and the two front ends
were twisted into single pipes of
hair; or the pipes of hair at the
side were entirely removed, and
one single pipe hung down the
back. The custom of thus
twisting the hair at the back,
and there holding it with a
ribbon, gave rise to the later
pigtail. The periwigs so altered
were known as short bobs, the bob being the fullness
of the hair by the cheeks of the wig.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 113px;">

alt="A man of the time of William and Mary" />
</div>

<p>The cuffs of the coat-sleeve varied to the idea
and taste of the owner of the coat; sometimes the
sleeve was widened at the elbow to 18 inches, and
the cuffs, turned back to meet the sleeves, were
wider still. Two, three, or even more buttons held
the cuff back.</p>

<p>The pockets on the coats were cut vertically and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>387]</a></span>
horizontally, and these also might be buttoned up.
Often the coat was held by only two centre buttons,
and the waistcoat flaps were
not buttoned at all. The
men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s muffs were
small, and often tied and slung
with ribbons.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 146px;">
<img src="images/ecill208.png" width="146" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of William and Mary" />
</div>

<p>Plain round riding-coats
were worn, fastened by a clasp
or a couple of large buttons.</p>

<p>The habit of tying the neckcloth
in a bow with full
hanging ends was dying out,
and a more loosely tied cravat
was being worn; this was
finished with fine lace
ends, and was frequently
worn quite long.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 229px;">
<img src="images/ecill209.png" width="229" height="250"
alt="Three men of the time of William and Mary" />
</div>

<p>Stockings were pulled
over the knee, and were
gartered below and rolled
above it.</p>

<p>The ordinary citizen
wore a modified edition
of these clothes&mdash;plain in cut, full, without half the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>388]</a></span>
number of buttons, and without the tremendous
periwig, wearing merely his own hair long.</p>

<p>For convenience in riding, the skirts of the coats
were slit up the back to the waist; this slit could
be buttoned up if need be.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 217px;">

</div>

<p>Now, let us give the dandy of this time his pipe,
and let him go in peace. Let us watch him stroll
down the street, planting
his high heels carefully,
to join two companions
outside the tobacco shop.
Here, by the great carved
wood figure of a smoking
Indian with his kilt of
tobacco leaves, he meets
his fellows. From the
hoop hung by the door
one chooses a pipe,
another asks for a quid to chew and a spittoon, the
third calls for a paper of snuff newly rasped. Then
they pull aside the curtains and go into the room
behind the shop, where, seated at a table made of
planks upon barrels, they will discuss the merits of
smoking, chewing, and snuffing.</p>

<h3>THE WOMEN</h3>

<p>Let me picture for you a lady of this time in the
language of those learned in dress, and you will see
how much it may benefit.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We see her coming afar off; against the yew
hedge her weeds shine for a moment. We see her
figuretto gown well looped and puffed with the
monte-la-haut. Her &eacute;chelle is beautiful, and her
pinner exquisitely worked. We can see her commode,
her top-not, and her fontage, for she wears
no rayonn&eacute;. A silver pin holds her meurtriers,
and the fashion suits better than did the cr&egrave;ve-c&oelig;urs.
One hand holds her Saxon green muffetee,
under one arm is her chapeau-bras. She is beautiful,
she needs no plumpers, and she regards us
kindly with her watchet eyes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A lady of this date would read this and enjoy it,
just as a lady of to-day would understand modern
dress language, which is equally peculiar to the
mere man. For example, this one of the Queen
of Spain&rsquo;s hats from her trousseau (curiously enough
a trousseau is a little bundle):</p>

<p>&lsquo;The hat is a paille d&rsquo;Italie trimmed with a profusion
of pink roses, accompanied by a pink chiffon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>390]</a></span>
ruffle fashioned into masses bouillonn&eacute;e arranged
at intervals and circled with wreaths of shaded
roses.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 184px;">
<img src="images/ecill211.png" width="184" height="250"
alt="Two women of the time of William and Mary" />
</div>

<p>The modern terms so vaguely used are shocking,
and the descriptive names given to colours by
dress-artists are horrible
beyond belief&mdash;such as
Watteau pink and elephant
grey, not to speak
of S&egrave;vres-blue cherries.</p>

<p>However, the female
mind delights in such
jargon and hotch-potch.</p>

<p>Let me be kind enough
to translate our William
and Mary fashion language.
&lsquo;Weeds&rsquo; is a term still in use in &lsquo;widow&rsquo;s weeds,&rsquo;
meaning the entire dress appearance of a woman.
A &lsquo;figuretto gown looped and puffed with the monte-la-haut&rsquo;
is a gown of figured material gathered into
loops over the petticoat and stiffened out with wires
&lsquo;monte-la-haut.&rsquo; The &lsquo;&eacute;chelle&rsquo; is a stomacher
laced with ribbons in rungs like a ladder. Her
&lsquo;pinner&rsquo; is her apron. The &lsquo;commode&rsquo; is the wire
frame over which the curls are arranged, piled up in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>391]</a></span>
high masses over the forehead. The &lsquo;top-not&rsquo; is a
large bow worn at the top of the commode; and the
&lsquo;fontage&rsquo; or &lsquo;tower&rsquo; is a French arrangement of
alternate layers of lace and ribbon raised one above
another about half a yard high. It was invented
in the time of Louis XIV.,
about 1680, by Mademoiselle
Fontage. The &lsquo;rayonn&eacute;&rsquo; is a
cloth hood pinned in a circle.
The &lsquo;meurtriers,&rsquo; or murderers,
are those twists in the hair
which tie or unloose the
arrangements of curls; and
the &lsquo;cr&egrave;ve-c&oelig;urs&rsquo; are the row
of little forehead curls of the
previous reign. A &lsquo;muffetee&rsquo;
is a little muff, and a &lsquo;chapeau-bras&rsquo; is a hat never
worn, but made to be carried under the arm by
men or women; for the men hated to disarrange
their wigs.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 154px;">
<img src="images/ecill212.png" width="154" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of William and Mary" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;Plumpers&rsquo; were artificial arrangements for filling
out the cheeks, and &lsquo;watchet&rsquo; eyes are blue
eyes.</p>

<p>The ladies have changed a good deal by the
middle of this reign: they have looped up the gown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>392]</a></span>
till it makes side-panniers and a bag-like droop at
the back; the under-gown has a long train, and the
bodice is long-waisted. The
front of the bodice is laced
open, and shows either an
arrangement of ribbon and
lace or a piece of the material
of the under-gown.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/ecill213.png" width="125" height="300"
alt="Two hair arrangements and necklines for women" />
</div>

<p>Black pinners in silk with a
deep frill are worn as well as
the white lace and linen ones.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 101px;">
<img src="images/ecill214.png" width="101" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of William and Mary" />
</div>

<p>The ladies wear short black
capes of this stuff with a
deep frill.</p>

<p>Sometimes, instead of the
fontage, a lady
wears a lace shawl over her head
and shoulders, or a sort of lace cap
bedizened with coloured ribbons.</p>

<p>Her sleeves are like a man&rsquo;s,
except that they come to the elbow
only, showing a white under-sleeve of lace gathered
into a deep frill of lace just below the elbow.</p>

frame called a &lsquo;commode.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She is very stiff and tight-laced, and very long in
the waist; and at the waist where the gown opens
and at the loopings of it the
richer wear jewelled brooches.</p>

<p>Later in the reign there began
a fashion for copying men&rsquo;s
clothes, and ladies wore wide
skirted coats with deep-flapped
pockets, the sleeves of the coats
down below the elbow and with
deep-turned overcuffs. They
wore, like the men, very much
puffed
and ruffled
linen and lace at the
wrists. Also they wore
men&rsquo;s waistcoat fashions,
carried sticks and little arm-hats&mdash;chapeau-bras. To
complete the dress the hair
was done in a bob-wig style,
and the cravat was tied
round their necks and
pinned. For the winter one of those loose Dutch
jackets lined and edged with fur, having wide sleeves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>394]</a></span>
The general tendency was to look Dutch, stiff,
prim, but very prosperous; even the country maid
in her best is close upon the heel of fashion with
her laced bodice, sleeves with cuffs, apron, and high-heeled
shoes.</p>

<h3>THE MEN AND WOMEN</h3>

<p>When I turn to the opening of the eighteenth
century, and leave Dutch William and his Hollands
and his pipe and his bulb-gardens behind, it seems
to me that there is a great noise, a tumultuous
chattering. We seem to burst upon a date of
talkers, of coffee-houses, of snuff and scandal. All
this was going on before, I say to myself&mdash;people
were wearing powdered wigs, and were taking snuff,
and were talking scandal, but it did not appeal so
forcibly.</p>

<p>We arrive at Sedan-chairs and hoops too big for
them; we arrive at red-heeled shoes. Though both
chairs and red heels belong to the previous reign,
still, we arrive at them now&mdash;they are very much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>396]</a></span>
in the picture. We seem to see a profusion, a confused
mass of bobbins and bone lace, mourning hatbands,
silk garters, amber canes correctly conducted,
country men in red coats, coxcombs, brass and
looking-glass snuff-boxes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 104px;">
<img src="images/ecill217.png" width="104" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of Anne" />
</div>

<p>Gentlemen walk past our mental vision with
seals curiously fancied and exquisitely well cut.
Ladies are sighing at the toss of
a wig or the tap on a snuff-box,
falling sick for a pair of striped
garters or a pair of fringed gloves.
Gentlemen are sitting baldheaded
in elegant dressing-gowns, while
their wigs are being taken out of
roulettes. The peruquier removes
the neat, warm clay tube, gives
a last pat to the fine pipes of the
hair, and then gently places the
wig on the waiting gentlemen.
If you can look through the
walls of London houses you will
next see regiments of gentlemen,
their faces pressed into glass cones, while
the peruquier tosses powder over their newly-put-on
periwigs. The bow at the end of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>397]</a></span>
long pigtail on the Ramillies wig is tied&mdash;that
is over.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF QUEEN ANNE (1702-1714)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">The coat has become still more full at the sides.
The hat has a more generous brim. Red heels in
fashion.</p>

<p>Running footmen, looking rather like Indians
from the outsides of tobacco shops, speed past. They
are dressed in close tunics with a fringed edge,
which flicks them just above the knee. Their legs
are tied up in leather guards, their feet are strongly
shod, their wigs are in small bobs. On their heads
are little round caps, with a
feather stuck in them. In
one hand they carry a long
stick about 5 feet high, in
the top knob of which they
carry some food or a message.
A message to whom?</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 149px;">
<img src="images/ecill218.png" width="149" height="250" alt="" />
<span class="caption">A Running Footman.</span>
</div>

<p>The running footman knocks
on a certain door, and delivers
to the pretty maid a note for
her ladyship from a handsome,
well-shaped youth who
frequents the coffee-houses about Charing Cross.
There is no answer to the note: her ladyship is too
disturbed with household affairs. Her Welsh maid
has left her under suspicious circumstances, and has
carried off some articles. The lady is even now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>398]</a></span>
writing to Mr. Bickerstaff of the <i>Tatler</i> to implore
his aid.</p>

<p>This is the list of the things she has missed&mdash;at
least, as much of the list as my mind remembers as
it travels back over the years:</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 122px;">
<img src="images/ecill219.png" width="122" height="250"

</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>A thick wadded Calico Wrapper.</p>

<p>A Musk-coloured Velvet Mantle lined with
Squirrels&rsquo; Skins.</p>

<p>Eight night shifts, four pairs of
stockings curiously darned.</p>

<p>Six pairs of laced Shoes, new
and old, with the heels of
half 2 inches higher than their
fellows.</p>

<p>A quilted Petticoat of the
largest size, and one of Canvas,
with whalebone hoops.</p>

<p>Three pairs of Stays boulstered
below the left shoulder. Two
pairs of Hips of the newest
fashion.</p>

<p>Six Roundabout Aprons, with
Pockets, and four strip&rsquo;d Muslin night
rails very little frayed.</p>

<p>A silver Cheese toaster with three tongues.</p>

<p>A silver Posnet to butter eggs.</p>

<p>A Bible bound in Shagreen, with guilt Leaves
and Clasps, never opened but once.</p>

<p>Two Leather Forehead Cloathes, three pair of
oiled Dogskin Gloves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>399]</a></span>
Two brand new Plumpers, three pair of fashionable
Eyebrows.</p>

<p>Adam and Eve in Bugle work, without Fig-leaves,
upon Canvas, curiously wrought
with her Ladyship&rsquo;s own hand.</p>

<p>Bracelets of braided Hair, Pomander, and Seed
Pearl.</p>

<p>A large old Purple Velvet Purse, embroidered,
and shutting with a spring, containing two
Pictures in Miniature, the Features visible.</p>

<p>A Silver gilt box for Cashu and Carraway Comfits
to be taken at long sermons.</p>

<p>A new Gold Repeating Watch made by a
Frenchman.</p>

<p>Together with a Collection of Receipts to make
Pastes for the Hands, Pomatums, Lip
Salves, White Pots, and Water of Talk.</p>
</div>

<p>Of these things one strikes the eye most curiously&mdash;the
canvas petticoat with whalebone hoops. It
dates the last, making me know that the good
woman lost her things in or about the year 1710.
We are just at the beginning of the era of the
tremendous hoop skirt.</p>

<p>This gentleman from the country will tell me all
about it. I stop him and remark his clothes; by
them I guess he has ridden from the country. He
is wearing a wide-skirted coat of red with deep
flap pockets; his coat has buttons from neck to hem,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>400]</a></span>
but only two or three&mdash;at the waist&mdash;are buttoned.
One hand, with the deep cuff pushed back from the
wrist to show his neat frilled shirt, is thrust into his
unbuttoned breeches pocket, the two pockets being
across the top of his breeches. Round his neck is a
black Steenkirk cravat (a black silk tie knotted and
twisted or allowed to hang over loose). His hat is of
black, and the wide brim is turned back from his forehead.
His wig is a short black periwig in bobs&mdash;that
is, it is gathered into bunches just on
the shoulders, and is twisted in a little
bob at the back of the neck. I have
forgotten whether he wore red or blue
stockings rolled above the knee, but
either is likely. His shoes are strong,
high-heeled, and have a big tongue
showing above the buckle.</p>

<p class="caption">A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF QUEEN
ANNE (1702-1714)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">Notice that the fontage has become much lower,
and the hoop of the skirt has become enormous.
The hair is more naturally dressed.</p>

<p>He tells me that in Norfolk, where
he has come from, the hoop has
not come into fashion; that ladies
there dress much as they did before Queen Anne
came to the throne. The fontage is lower,
perhaps, the waist may be longer, but skirts are
full and have long trains, and are gathered in
loops to show the petticoat of silk with its deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>401]</a></span>
double row of flounces. Aprons are worn long,
and have good pockets. Cuffs are deep, but are
lowered to below the elbow. The bodice of the
gown is cut high in the back and low in front,
and is decked with a deep frill of lace or linen,
which allows less bare neck to show than formerly.
A very observant gentleman! &lsquo;But you have
seen the new hoop?&rsquo; I ask him.
Yes, he has seen it. As he rode into
town he noticed that the old fashions
gave way to new, that every mile
brought the fontage lower and the
hair more hidden, until short curls
and a little cap of linen or lace
entirely replaced the old high head-dress
and the profusion of curls on
the shoulders. The hoop, he noticed,
became larger and larger as he
neared the town, and the train grew shorter, and
the patterns on the under-skirt grew larger with
the hoop.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 116px;">
<img src="images/ecill221.png" width="116" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of Anne" />
</div>

<p>I leave my gentleman from the country and
I stroll about the streets to regard the fashions.
Here, I see, is a gentleman in one of the new
Ramillies wigs&mdash;a wig of white hair drawn back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>402]</a></span>
from the forehead and puffed out full over the
ears. At the back the wig is gathered into a
long queue, the plaited or twisted tail of a wig,
and is ornamented
at the top and bottom
of the queue with a
black bow.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 186px;">
<img src="images/ecill222.png" width="186" height="250"
alt="Ramillies Wig; Black Steenkirk; a hat for men" />
</div>

<p>I notice that this
gentleman is dressed
in more easy fashion
than some. His coat
is not buttoned, the
flaps of his waistcoat
are not over
big, his breeches are
easy, his tie is loose.
I know where this
gentleman has stepped from; he has come straight
out of a sampler of mine, by means of which
piece of needlework I can get his story without
book. I know that he has a tremendous
periwig at home covered with scented powder; I
know that he has an elegant suit with fullness
of the skirts, at his sides gathered up to a button
of silver gilt; there is plenty of lace on this coat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>403]</a></span>
and deep bands of it on the cuffs. He has also,
I am certain, a cane with an amber head very
curiously clouded, and this cane he hangs on to
his fifth button by a blue silk ribbon. This cane
is never used except to lift it up at a coachman,
hold it over the head of a drawer, or point out
the circumstances of a story. Also, he has a single
eyeglass, or perspective, which he will advance to
his eye to gaze at a toast or an orange wench.</p>

<p>There is another figure on the sampler&mdash;a lady
in one of those wide hoops; she has a fan in her
hand. I know her as well as
the gentleman, and know that
she can use her fan as becomes
a prude or a coquette. I know
she takes her chocolate in bed
at nine in the morning, at
eleven she drinks a dish of
bohea, tries a new head at
her twelve o&rsquo;clock toilette,
and at two cheapens fans at
the Change.</p>

<p>I have seen her at her mantua-makers; I have
watched her embroider a corner of her flower
handkerchief, and give it up to sit before her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>404]</a></span>
glass to determine a patch. She is a good coachwoman,
and puts her dainty laced shoe against
the opposite seat to balance herself against the
many jolts; meanwhile she takes her mask off
for a look at the passing world. If only I could
ride in the coach with her! If only I could I
should see the fruit wenches in sprigged petticoats
and flat, broad-brimmed hats; the
ballad-sellers in tattered long-skirted
coats; the country women
in black hoods and cloaks, and
the men in frieze coats. The ladies
would pass by in pearl necklaces,
flowered stomachers, artificial
nosegays, and shaded furbelows:
one is noted by her muff, one by
her tippet, one by her fan. Here
a gentleman bows to our coach,
and my lady&rsquo;s heart beats to see his open waistcoat,
his red heels, his suit of flowered satin. I should
not fail to notice the monstrous petticoats worn by
ladies in chairs or in coaches, these hoops stuffed
out with cordage and stiffened with whalebone, and,
according to Mr. Bickerstaff, making the women
look like extinguishers&mdash;&lsquo;with a little knob at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>405]</a></span>
upper end, and widening downward till it ends in a
basis of a most enormous circumference.&rsquo;</p>

<p>To finish. I quite agree with Mr. Bickerstaff,
when he mentions the great shoe-shop at the
St. James&rsquo;s end of Pall Mall, that the shoes there
displayed, notably the slippers with green lace and
blue heels, do create irregular thoughts in the
youth of this nation.</p>

<h3>THE MEN AND WOMEN</h3>

<p>We cannot do better
than open Thackeray,
and put a finger on this
passage:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;There is the Lion&rsquo;s
Head, down whose jaws
the Spectator&rsquo;s own letters
were passed; and
over a great banker&rsquo;s in
Fleet Street the effigy of
the wallet, which the founder of the firm bore when
he came into London a country boy. People this
street, so ornamented with crowds of swinging
chairmen, with servants bawling to clear the way,
with Mr. Dean in his cassock, his lacquey marching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>407]</a></span>
before him; or Mrs. Dinah in her sack, tripping to
chapel, her footboy carrying her ladyship&rsquo;s great
prayer-book; with itinerant tradesmen, singing
their hundred cries (I remember forty years ago, as
a boy in London city, a score of cheery, familiar
cries that are silent now).</p>

<p>&lsquo;Fancy the beaux thronging to the chocolate-houses,
tapping their snuff-boxes as they issue
thence, their periwig appearing over the red
curtains. Fancy Saccharissa beckoning and smiling
from the upper windows, and a crowd of soldiers
bawling and bustling at the door&mdash;gentlemen of
the Life Guards, clad in scarlet with blue facings,
and laced with gold at the seams; gentlemen of
the Horse Grenadiers, in their caps of sky-blue
cloth, with the garter embroidered on the front in
gold and silver; men of the Halberdiers, in their
long red coats, as bluff Harry left them, with their
ruffs and velvet flat-caps. Perhaps the King&rsquo;s
Majesty himself is going to St. James&rsquo;s as we pass.&rsquo;</p>

</div>

<p>We find ourselves, very willingly, discussing the
shoes of the King of France with a crowd of
powdered beaux; those shoes the dandyism of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>408]</a></span>
which has never been surpassed, the heels, if you
please, painted by Vandermeulen with scenes from
Rhenish victories! Or we go to
the toy-shops in Fleet Street,
where we may make assignations
or buy us a mask, where loaded
dice are slyly handed over the
counter. Everywhere&mdash;the beau.
He rides the world like a cock-horse,
or like Og the giant rode
the Ark of Noah, steering it with
his feet, getting his washing for
nothing, and his meals passed up
to him out by the chimney. Here
is the old soldier begging in his
tattered coat of red; here is a
suspicious-looking character with a
black patch over his eye; here the
whalebone hoop of a petticoat takes
up the way, and above the monstrous
hoop is the tight bodice,
and out of that comes the shoulders
supporting the radiant Molly&mdash;patches,
powder, paint, and smiles. Here a woman
passes in a Nithsdale hood, covering her from head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>409]</a></span>
to foot&mdash;this great cloak with a piquant history of
prison-breaking; here, with a clatter of high red
heels, the beau, the everlasting beau, in gold lace,
wide cuffs, full skirts, swinging cane. A scene of
flashing colours. The coats embroidered with
flowers and butterflies, the cuffs a mass of fine
sewing, the three-cornered hats cocked at a jaunty
angle, the stockings rolled above the
knee. Wigs in three divisions of loops
at the back pass by, wigs in long
queues, wigs in back and side bobs.
Lacquer-hilted swords, paste buckles,
gold and silver snuff-boxes flashing in
the sun, which struggles through the
mass of swinging signs.</p>

<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF GEORGE I. (1714-1727)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">The buckles on the shoes are now much larger; the
stockings are loosely rolled above the knee. The
great periwig is going out, and the looped and curled
wig, very white with powder, is in fashion.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 84px;">
<img src="images/ecill228.png" width="84" height="300"
alt="A hat; coat tails; a wig" />
</div>

<p>There is a curious sameness about
the clean-shaven faces surmounted by
white wigs; there is&mdash;if we believe the
pictures&mdash;a tendency to fat due to the
tight waist of the breeches or the
buckling of the belts. The ladies wear
little lace and linen caps, their hair
escaping in a ringlet or so at the side, and flowing
down behind, or gathered close up to a small knob
on the head. The gentlemen&rsquo;s coats fall in full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>410]</a></span>
folds on either side; the back, at present, has
not begun to stick out so heavily with buckram.
Aprons for ladies are still worn. Silks and satins,
brocades and fine cloths, white wigs powdering
velvet shoulders, crowds of cut-throats, elegant
gentlemen, patched Aspasias, tavern swindlers,
foreign adventurers, thieves, a highwayman, a footpad,
a poor poet&mdash;and narrow streets and mud.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 111px;">
<img src="images/ecill229.png" width="111" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of George I." />
</div>

<p>Everywhere we see the skirted coat, the big
flapped waistcoat; even beggar boys, little pot-high
urchins, are wearing some old laced waistcoat tied
with string about their middles&mdash;a
pair of heel-trodden, buckleless shoes
on their feet, more likely bare-footed.
Here is a man snatched from the
tripe-shop in Hanging Sword Alley
by the King&rsquo;s men&mdash;a pickpocket, a
highwayman, a cut-throat in hiding.
He will repent his jokes on Jack
Ketch&rsquo;s kitchen when he feels the lash
of the whip on his naked shoulders
as he screams behind the cart-tail;
ladies in flowered hoops will stop to look at him,
beaux will lift their quizzing glasses, a young girl
will whisper behind a fan, painted with the loves of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>411]</a></span>
Jove, to a gorgeous young fop in a light-buttoned
coat of sky-blue.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 66px;">
<img src="images/ecill230.png" width="66" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of George I." />
</div>

<p>There is a sadder sight to come, a cart on the
way to Tyburn, a poor fellow standing by his coffin
with a nosegay in his breast; he is full
of Dutch courage, for, as becomes a
notorious highwayman, he must show
game before the crowd, so he is full
of stum and Yorkshire stingo. Maybe
we stop to see a pirate hanging in
chains by the river, and we are jostled
by horse officers and
watermen, revenue men
and jerkers, and, as
usual, the curious beau,
his glass to his eye.
Never was such a time
for curiosity: a man is preaching
mystic religion; there is a new
flavour to the Rainbow Tavern
furmity; there is a fellow who
can sew with his toes; a man
is in the pillory for publishing Jacobite ballads&mdash;and
always there is the beau looking on.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 127px;">
<img src="images/ecill231.png" width="127" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of George I." />
</div>

<p>Country ladies, still in small hoops, even in full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>412]</a></span>
dresses innocent of whalebone, are bewildered by
the noise; country gentlemen, in plain-coloured
coats and stout shoes, have come to
London on South Sea Bubble business.
They will go to the Fair to see the Harlequin
and Scaramouch dance, they will buy
a new perfume at The Civet Cat, and they
will go home&mdash;the lady&rsquo;s head full of the
new hoop fashion, and she will cut away
the sleeve of her old dress and put in
fresh lace; the gentleman full of curses on
tavern bills and the outrageous
price of South Sea shares.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 79px;">
<img src="images/ecill232.png" width="79" height="250"

</div>

<p>&lsquo;And what,&rsquo; says country dame to
country dame lately from town&mdash;&lsquo;what
is the mode in gentlemen&rsquo;s hair?&rsquo; Her
own goodman has an old periwig,
very full, and a small bob for ordinary
wear.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 74px;">
<img src="images/ecill233.png" width="74" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of George I." />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;The very full periwig is going out,&rsquo;
our lady assures her; &lsquo;a tied wig is
quite the mode, a wig in three queues
tied in round bobs, or in hair loops, and
the long single queue wig is coming in rapidly,
and will soon be all the wear.&rsquo; So, with talk of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>413]</a></span>
flowered tabbies and fine lutestring, are the fashions
passed on.</p>

<p>Just as Sir Roger de Coverley nearly called a
young lady in riding-dress &lsquo;sir,&rsquo; because of the
upper half of her body, so the ladies of this day
might well be taken for &lsquo;sirs,&rsquo;
with their double-breasted
riding-coats like the men, and
their hair in a queue surmounted
by a cocked hat.</p>

<p>Colours and combinations
of colours are very striking:
petticoats of black satin
covered with large bunches
of worked flowers, morning
gown of yellow flowered satin faced with cherry-coloured
bands, waistcoats of one colour with a
fringe of another, bird&rsquo;s-eye hoods, bodices covered
with gold lace and embroidered flowers&mdash;all these
gave a gay, artificial appearance to the age; but we
are to become still more quaintly devised, still more
powdered and patched, in the next reign.</p>

<h2>GEORGE THE SECOND</h2>

<p class="smlfont center">Reigned thirty-three years: 1727-1760.</p>

<p class="smlfont center">Born 1683. Married, 1705, Caroline of Anspach.</p>


<h3>THE MEN</h3>

<p>Just a few names of wigs, and you will see how
the periwig has gone into the background, how
the bob-wig has superseded the campaign wig; you
will find a veritable confusion of barbers&rsquo; enthusiasms,
half-forgotten designs, names dependent
on a twist, a lock, a careful disarrangement&mdash;pigeon&rsquo;s-wing
wigs with wings of hair at the sides,
comets with long, full tails, cauliflowers with a
profusion of curls, royal bind-wigs, staircase wigs,
ladders, brushes, Count Saxe wigs, cut bobs, long
bobs, negligents, chain-buckles, drop-wigs, bags.
Go and look at Hogarth; there&rsquo;s a world of dress
for you by the grim humorist who painted Sarah
Malcolm, the murderess, in her cell; who painted
&lsquo;Taste in High Life.&rsquo; Wigs! inexhaustible subject&mdash;wigs
passing from father to son until they arrived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>415]</a></span>
at the second-hand dealers in Monmouth Street, and
there, after a rough overhauling, began a new life.
There was a wig lottery at sixpence a ticket in
Rosemary Lane, and with even ordinary wigs&mdash;Grizzle
Majors
at twenty-five
shillings, Great
Tyes at a
guinea, and
Brown Bagwigs
at fifteen
shillings&mdash;quite
a considerable
saving
might be
made by the
lucky lottery
winner.</p>

<img src="images/ecill235.png" width="253" height="300"
alt="Back view of a man's coat; seven types of hat for men" />
</div>

<p>On wigs,
hats cocked to suit the passing fashion, broad-brimmed,
narrow-brimmed, round, three-cornered,
high-brimmed, low-brimmed, turned high off the
forehead, turned low in front and high at the back&mdash;an
endless crowd. Such a day for clothes, for
patches, and politics, Tory side and Whig to your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>416]</a></span>
face, Tory or Whig cock to your hat; pockets high,
pockets low, stiff cuffs, crushable cuffs, a regular
jumble of go-as-you-please.
Let
me try to sort the
jumble.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 248px;">
<img src="images/ecill236.png" width="248" height="250"
alt="1739: Two views of a coat for men" />

<img src="images/ecill237.png" width="262" height="300"
alt="A man of the time of George II.; a sleeve; a waistcoat" />
</div>

<p>Foremost, the
coat. The coat is
growing more full,
more spread; it becomes,
on the beau,
a great spreading,
flaunting, skirted
affair just buttoned by
a button or two at the
waist. It is laced or
embroidered all over;
it is flowered or plain.
The cuffs are huge;
they will, of course,
suit the fancy of the
owner, or the tailor.
About 1745 they will
get small&mdash;some will
get small; then the fashions begin to run riot; by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>417]</a></span>
the cut of coat you may not know the date of it,
then, when you pass it in the street. From 1745
there begins the same jumble as to-day, a hopeless
thing to unravel; in the next reign, certainly, you
may tell yourself here is one of the new Macaronis,
but that will be all you will mark out of the
crowd of fashions&mdash;one more remarkable, newer
than the rest, but perhaps you have been in the
country for a week, and a new
mode has come in and is dying out.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 443px;">

</div>

<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF GEORGE II. (1727-1760)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">Notice the heavy cuffs, and the very full skirts
of the coat. He carries a <i>chapeau bras</i> under his
arm&mdash;a hat for carrying only, since he will not
ruffle his wig. He wears a black satin tie to his wig,
the ends of which tie come round his neck, are made
into a bow, and brooched with a solitaire.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 117px;">
<img src="images/ecill238.png" width="117" height="250"
alt="A man of the time of George II." />
</div>

<p>From coat let us look at waistcoat.
Full flaps and long almost to
the knees; but again, about 1756,
they will be shorter. They are
fringed, flowered, laced, open to
show the lace cravat fall so daintily,
to show the black velvet bow-tie
that comes over from the black
velvet, or silk, or satin tie of the
queue. Ruffles of lace, of all qualities, at the
wrists, the beau&rsquo;s hand emerging with his snuff-box
from a filmy froth of white lace.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 235px;">
<img src="images/ecill239.png" width="235" height="300"
alt="A man of the time of George II.; a wig; breeches and stockings" />
</div>

<p>In this era of costume&mdash;from George I. to
George IV.&mdash;the great thing to remember is that
the coat changes more than anything else; from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>418]</a></span>
the stiff William and Mary coat with its deep, stiff
cuffs, you see the change towards the George I.
coat, a looser cut of the same design, still simple in
embroideries; then the coat skirts are gathered to
a button at each side of the coat just behind the
pockets. Then, in George II.&rsquo;s reign, the skirt hangs
in parallel folds free from the button, and shapes to
the back more closely, the opening of the coat, from
the neck to the
waist, being so cut
as to hang over
the buttons and
show the cravat
and the waistcoat.
Then, later in the
same reign, we see
the coat with the
skirts free of buckram
and very full
all round, and the
cuffs also free of
stiffening and folding
with the crease of the elbow. Then, about 1745,
we get the coat left more open, and, for the beau,
cut much shorter&mdash;this often worn over a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419"><!-- original location - full page illustration of coats --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>420]</a></span>
double-breasted waistcoat. Then, arriving at George III.,
we get a long series of coat changes, with a collar on
it, turned over and standing high in the neck, with
the skirts buttoned back, then cut away; then the
front of the coat cut away like the modern dress-coat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/ecill240.png" width="375" height="600"
alt="Four men of the time of George II." />
</div>

<p>In following out these really complicated changes,
I have done my best to make my meaning clear by
placing dates against those drawings where dates
are valuable, hoping by this means to show the rise
and fall of certain fashions more clearly than any
description would do.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that, for ceremony, the periwig
gave place to the tie-wig, or, in some few cases, to
natural hair curled and powdered. The older men
kept to the periwig no doubt from fondness of the
old and, as they thought, more grave fashion; but,
as I showed at the beginning of the chapter, the
beau and the young man, even the quite middle-class
man, wore, or had the choice of wearing,
endless varieties of false attires of hair.</p>

<p>The sporting man had his own idea of dress,
even as to-day he has a piquant idea in clothes, and
who shall say he has not the right? A black wig,
a jockey cap with a bow at the back of it, a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>421]</a></span>
resplendent morning gown richly laced, a morning
cap, and very comfortable embroidered slippers,
such mixtures of clothes in his wardrobe&mdash;his coat,
no doubt, a little over-full, but of good cloth, his
fine clothes rather over-embroidered, his tie-wig
often pushed too far back on his forehead, and so
showing his cropped hair underneath.</p>

<p>Muffs must be remembered, as every dandy carried
a muff in winter, some big, others grotesquely small.
Bath must be remembered, and the great Beau
Nash in the famous Pump-Room&mdash;as Thackeray
says, so say I: &lsquo;I should like to have seen the Folly,&rsquo;
he says, meaning Nash. &lsquo;It was a splendid embroidered,
beruffled, snuff-boxed, red-heeled, impertinent
Folly, and knew how to make itself respected.
I should like to have seen that noble old madcap
Peterborough in his boots (he actually had the
audacity to walk about Bath in boots!), with his
blue ribbon and stars, and a cabbage under each
arm, and a chicken in his hand, which he had been
cheapening for his dinner.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was the fashion to wear new clothes on the
Queen&rsquo;s birthday, March 1, and then the streets
noted the loyal people who indulged their extravagance
or pushed a new fashion on that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>422]</a></span>
Do not forget that no hard-and-fast rules can be
laid down; a man&rsquo;s a man for all his tailor tells him
he is a walking fashion plate. Those who liked
short cuffs wore them, those who did not care for
solitaires did without; the height of a heel, the
breadth of a
buckle, the sweep
of a skirt, all lay
at the taste of the
owner&mdash;merely
would I have you
remember the
essentials.</p>

</div>

<p>There was a
deal of dressing
up&mdash;the King,
bless you, in a
Turkish array at a masque&mdash;the day of the Corydon
and Sylvia: mock shepherd, dainty shepherdess was
here; my lord in silk loose coat with paste buttons,
fringed waistcoat, little three-cornered hat under his
arm, and a pastoral staff between his fingers, a crook
covered with cherry and blue ribbons; and my lady
in such a hoop of sprigged silk or some such stuff,
the tiniest of straw hat on her head, high heels

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>424]</a></span>
tapping the ground, all a-shepherding&mdash;what?
Cupids, I suppose, little Dresden loves, little
comfit-box jokes, little spiteful remarks about the
Germans.</p>

<p>Come, let me doff my Kevenhuller hat with the
gold fringe, bring my red heels together with a
smart tap, bow, with my hand on the third button
of my coat from which my stick dangles, and let
me introduce the ladies.</p>


<h3>THE WOMEN</h3>

patched, perfumed sex (though this would do for
man or woman of the great world then) by some
lines from the <i>Bath Guide</i>:</p>

<p class="caption">A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF GEORGE II. (1727-1760)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">She is wearing a large pinner over her dress. Notice
the large panniers, the sleeves without cuffs, the tied
cap, and the shortness of the skirts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 412px;">
<img src="images/ecill243.png" width="412" height="250"
alt="Three women of the time of George II." />
</div>

<p>Now I think it will be best to describe a lady
of quality. In the first years of the reign she
still wears the large hoop skirt, a circular whalebone
arrangement started at the waist, and, at
intervals,
the hoops
were placed
so that the
petticoat
stood out
all round
like a bell;
over this the
skirt hung stiff and solemn. The bodice was tight-laced,
cut square in front where the neckerchief
of linen or lace made the edge soft. The sleeves
still retained the cuff covering the elbow, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426"><!-- original location - full page illustration of four women --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>427]</a></span>
under-sleeve of linen with lace frills came half-way
down the forearm, leaving bare arm and
wrist to show.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 374px;">
<img src="images/ecill244.png" width="374" height="600"
alt="Four women of the time of George II." />
</div>

<p>Over the skirt she would wear, as her taste
held her, a long, plain apron, or a long, tucked
apron, or an apron to her knees. The bodice
generally formed the top of a gown, which gown
was very full-skirted, and was divided so as to
hang back behind the dress, showing, often, very
little in front. This will be seen clearly in the
illustrations.</p>

<p>The hair is very tightly gathered up behind,
twisted into a small knob on the top of the head,
and either drawn straight back from the forehead
or parted in the middle, allowing a small fringe
to hang on the temples. Nearly every woman
wore a small cap or a small round straw hat with
a ribbon round it.</p>

<p>The lady&rsquo;s shoes would be high-heeled and
pointed-toed, with a little buckle and strap.</p>

<p>About the middle of the reign the sacque
became the general town fashion, the sacque being
so named on account of the back, which fell from
the shoulders into wide, loose folds over the hooped
petticoat. The sacque was gathered at the back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>428]</a></span>
in close pleats, which fell open over the skirt part
of this dress. The front of the sacque was sometimes
open, sometimes
made tight in the
bodice.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 212px;">
<img src="images/ecill245.png" width="212" height="250"
alt="A woman of the time of George II.; four types of shoe" />
</div>

<p>Now the lady would
puff her hair at the
sides and powder it;
if she had no hair she
wore false, and a little
later a full wig. She
would now often discard
her neat cap
and wear a veil behind
her back, over her hair, and falling over her
shoulders.</p>

<p>In 1748, so they say, and so I believe to be true,
the King, walking in the Mall, saw the Duchess
of Bedford riding in a blue riding-habit with white
silk facings&mdash;this would be a man&rsquo;s skirted coat,
double-breasted, a cravat, a three-corned hat, and
a full blue skirt. He admired her dress so much
and thought it so neat that he straightway ordered
that the officers of the navy, who, until now, had
worn scarlet, should take this coat for the model
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>429]</a></span>
of their new uniform. So did the navy go into
blue and white.</p>

<p>The poorer classes were not, of course, dressed
in hooped skirts, but the bodice and gown over
the petticoat, the apron, and the turned back cuff
to the short sleeve were worn by all. The orange
wench laced her gown
neatly, and wore a
white cloth tied over
her head; about her
shoulders she wore a
kerchief of white, and
often a plain frill of
linen at her elbows.
There were blue canvas,
striped dimity,
flannel, and ticken for
the humble; for the
rich, lustrings, satins, Padesois, velvets, damasks,
fans and Leghorn hats, bands of Valenciennes
and Point de Dunquerque&mdash;these might be bought
of Mrs. Holt, whose card Hogarth engraved, at
the Two Olive Posts in the Broad part of the
Strand.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 221px;">
<img src="images/ecill246.png" width="221" height="250"
alt="Two women of the time of George II." />
</div>

<p>Seventeen hundred and fifty-five saw the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>430]</a></span>
one-horse chairs introduced from France, called
cabriolets, the first of our own extraordinary
wild-looking conveyances contrived for the minimum
of comfort and the maximum of danger.
This invention captivated the hearts of both men
and women. The men painted cabriolets on
their waistcoats, they embroidered them on their
stockings, they cut them out in black silk and
patched their cheeks with them, horse and all;
the women began to take up, a little later, the
cabriolet caps with round sides like linen wheels,
and later still, at the very end of the reign, there
began a craze for such head-dresses&mdash;post-chaises,
chairs and chairmen, even waggons, and this craze
grew and grew, and hair grew&mdash;in wigs&mdash;to meet
the cry for hair and straw men-of-war, for loads
of hay, for birds of paradise, for goodness knows
what forms of utter absurdity, all of which I put
down to the introduction of the cab.</p>

<p>I think that I can best describe the lady of
this day as a swollen, skirted figure with a pinched
waist, little head of hair, or tiny cap, developing
into a loose sacque-backed figure still whaleboned
out, with hair puffed at the sides and powdered,
getting ready to develop again into a queer figure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>431]</a></span>
under a tower of hair, but that waits for the
next reign.</p>

<p>One cannot do better than go to Hogarth&rsquo;s prints
and pictures&mdash;wonderful
records of this time&mdash;one
picture especially, &lsquo;Taste
in High Life,&rsquo; being a fine
record of the clothes of
1742; here you will see
the panier and the sacque,
the monstrous muff, the
huge hoop, the long-tailed
wig, the black boy and the
monkey. In the &lsquo;Noon&rsquo; of
the &lsquo;Four Parts of the Day&rsquo; there are clothes again
satirized.</p>

alt="A woman of the time of George II.; a shawl" />
</div>

<p>I am trusting that the drawings will supply what
my words have failed to picture, and I again&mdash;for the
twenty-first time&mdash;repeat that, given the cut and the
idea of the time, the student has always to realize
that there can be no hard-and-fast rule about the
fashions; with the shape he can take liberties up
to the points shown, with colour he can do anything&mdash;patterns
of the materials are obtainable, and
Hogarth will give anything required in detail.</p>

<h2>GEORGE THE THIRD</h2>

<p class="smlfont center">Reigned sixty years: 1760-1820.</p>

<p class="smlfont center">Born 1738. Married, 1761, Charlotte Sophia
of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.</p>


<h3>THE MEN AND WOMEN</h3>

<p>Throughout this long reign the changes of costume
are so frequent, so varied, and so jumbled
together, that any precise account of them would
be impossible. I have endeavoured to give a
leading example of most kind of styles in the
budget of drawings which goes with this chapter.</p>

<p>Details concerning this reign are so numerous:
Fashion books, fashion articles in the <i>London
Magazine</i>, the <i>St. James&rsquo;s Chronicle</i>, works innumerable
on hair-dressing, tailors&rsquo; patterns&mdash;these
are easily within the reach of those who hunt the
second-hand shops, or are within reasonable distance
of a library.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 267px;">

<img src="images/ecpl67.jpg" width="267" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF GEORGE III. (1760-1820)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">The full-skirted coat, though still worn, has given
way, in general, to the tail-coat. The waistcoat is
much shorter. Black silk knee-breeches and stockings
are very general.</p>

<p>Following my drawings, you will see in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433"><!-- original location - full page illustration of head-gear and shoes --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>434]</a></span>
first the ordinary wig, skirted coat, knee-breeches,
chapeau-bras, cravat or waistcoat, of the man about
town. I do not mean of the exquisite about town,
but, if you will take it kindly, just such clothes as
you or I might have worn.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 367px;">
<img src="images/ecill248.png" width="367" height="600"
alt="Eleven types of head-dress for women; three types of shoe" />
</div>

<p>In the second drawing we see a fashionable man,
who might have strutted past the first fellow in
the Park. His hair is dressed in a twisted roll;
he wears a tight-brimmed little hat, a frogged coat,
a fringed waistcoat, striped breeches, and buckled
shoes.</p>

<p>In the third we see the dress of a Macaroni.
On his absurd wig he wears a little Nevernoise
hat; his cravat is tied in a bow; his breeches are
loose, and beribboned at the knee. Many of these
Macaronis wore coloured strings at the knee of
their breeches, but the fashion died away when Jack
Rann, &lsquo;Sixteen String Jack,&rsquo; as he was called after
this fashion, had been hung in this make of breeches.</p>

<p>In number four we see the development of the
tail-coat and the high-buttoned waistcoat. The
tail-coat is, of course, son to the frock-coat, the
skirts of which, being inconvenient for riding, had
first been buttoned back and then cut back to
give more play.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 384px;">

<img src="images/ecpl68.jpg" width="384" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF GEORGE III. (1760-1820)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">In the earlier half of the reign. Notice her sack
dress over a satin dress, and the white, elaborately
made skirt. Also the big cap and the curls of white
wig.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>435]</a></span>
In the fifth drawing we see the double-breasted
cut-away coat.</p>

<p>Number six is but a further tail-coat design.</p>

<p>Number seven shows how different were the
styles at one time. Indeed, except for the
Macaroni and other extreme fashions, the entire
budget of men as shown might have formed a
crowd in the Park on one day about twenty years
before the end of the reign. There would not be
much powdered hair after 1795, but a few examples
would remain.</p>

<p>A distinct change is shown in the eighth drawing
of the long-tailed, full coat, the broad hat, the
hair powdered, but not tied.</p>

<p>Number nine is another example of the same
style.</p>

<p>The tenth drawing shows the kind of hat we
associate with Napoleon, and, in fact, very Napoleonic
garments.</p>

<p>In eleven we have a distinct change in the
appearance of English dress. The gentleman is
a Zebra, and is so-called from his striped clothes.
He is, of course, in the extreme of fashion, which
did not last for long; but it shows a tendency
towards later Georgian appearance&mdash;the top-hat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436"><!-- original location - full page illustration of hair and hats --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>437]</a></span>
the shorter hair, the larger neckcloth, the pantaloons&mdash;forerunners
of Brummell&rsquo;s invention&mdash;the
open sleeve.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 374px;">
<img src="images/ecill249.png" width="374" height="600"
alt="Fourteen styles of hair and hats for men" />

<img src="images/ecpl69.jpg" width="430" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">A MAN OF THE TIME OF GEORGE III. (1760-1820)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">The cuffs have gone, and now the sleeve is left
unbuttoned at the wrist. The coat is long and full-skirted,
but not stiffened. The cravat is loosely tied,
and the frilled ends stick out. These frills were, in
the end, made on the shirt, and were called chitterlings.</p>

<p>Number twelve shows us an ordinary gentleman
in a coat and waistcoat, with square flaps, called
dog&rsquo;s ears.</p>

<p>As the drawings continue you can see that the
dress became more and more simple, more like
modern evening dress as to the coats, more like
modern stiff fashion about the neck.</p>

<p>The drawings of the women&rsquo;s dresses should
also speak for themselves. You may watch the
growth of the wig and the decline of the hoop&mdash;I
trust with ease. You may see those towers of
hair of which there are so many stories. Those
masses of meal and stuffing, powder and pomatum,
the dressing of which took many hours. Those
piles of decorated, perfumed, reeking mess, by
which a lady could show her fancy for the navy
by balancing a straw ship on her head, for sport
by showing a coach, for gardening by a regular
bed of flowers. Heads which were only dressed,
perhaps, once in three weeks, and were then rescented
because it was necessary. Monstrous
germ-gatherers of horse-hair, hemp-wool, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>438]</a></span>
powder, laid on in a paste, the cleaning of which
is too awful to give in full detail. &lsquo;Three
weeks,&rsquo; says my lady&rsquo;s hairdresser, &lsquo;is as long as
a head can go well in the summer without being
opened.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="caption">A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF GEORGE III. (1760-1820)</p>

<p class="subcapt ipadbase">This shows the last of the pannier dresses, which
gave way in 1794 or 1795 to Empire dresses. A
change came over all dress after the Revolution.</p>

<p>Then we go on to the absurd idea which came
over womankind that it was most becoming to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>439]</a></span>
look like a pouter pigeon. She took to a buffon,
a gauze or fine linen kerchief, which stuck out
pigeon-like in front, giving an exaggerated bosom
to those who wore it. With this fashion of 1786
came the broad-brimmed hat.</p>

<p>Travel a little further and you have the mob
cap.</p>

<p>All of a sudden out go hoops, full skirts, high
hair, powder, buffons, broad-brimmed hats, patches,
high-heeled shoes, and in come willowy figures
and thin, nearly transparent dresses, turbans, low
shoes, straight fringes.</p>

<p>I am going to give a chapter from a fashion
book, to show you how impossible it is to deal
with the vagaries of fashion in the next reign, and
if I chose to occupy the space, I could give a similar
chapter to make the confusion of this reign more
confounded.</p>

<h2>GEORGE THE FOURTH</h2>

<p class="smlfont center">Reigned ten years: 1820-1830.</p>

<p class="smlfont center">Born 1762. Married, 1795, Caroline of Brunswick.</p>


<p>Out of the many fashion books of this time I have
chosen, from a little brown book in front of me, a
description of the fashions for ladies during one
part of 1827. It will serve to show how mere
man, blundering on the many complexities of the
feminine passion for dress&mdash;I was going to say
clothes&mdash;may find himself left amid a froth of frills,
high and dry, except for a whiff of spray, standing
in his unromantic garments on the shore of the
great world of gauze and gussets, while the most
noodle-headed girl sails gracefully away upon the
high seas to pirate some new device of the Devil or
Paris.</p>

<p>Our wives&mdash;bless them!&mdash;occasionally treat us
to a few bewildering terms, hoping by their gossamer
knowledge to present to our gaze a mental picture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>441]</a></span>
of a new, adorable, ardently desired&mdash;hat. Perhaps
those nine proverbial tailors who go to make the
one proverbial man, least of his sex, might, by a
strenuous effort, confine the history of clothes
during this reign into a compact literature of forty
volumes. It would be indecent, as undecorous as
the advertisements in ladies&rsquo; papers, to attempt to
fathom the language of the man who endeavoured
to read the monumental effigy to the vanity of
human desire for adornment. But is it adornment?</p>

<p>Nowadays to be dressed well is not always the
same thing as to be well dressed. Often it is far
from it. The question of modern clothes is one of
great perplexity. It seems that what is beauty
one year may be the abomination of desolation the
next, because the trick of that beauty has become
common property. You puff your hair at the sides,
you are in the true sanctum of the mode; you
puff your hair at the sides, you are for ever utterly
cast out as one having no understanding. I shall
not attempt to explain it: it passes beyond the
realms of explanation into the pure air of Truth.
The Truth is simple. Aristocracy being no longer
real, but only a cult, one is afraid of one&rsquo;s servants.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>442]</a></span>
Your servant puffs her hair at the sides, and, hang
it! she becomes exactly like an aristocrat. Our
servant having dropped her <i>g&rsquo;s</i> for many years as
well as her <i>h&rsquo;s</i>, it behoved us to pronounce our <i>g&rsquo;s</i>
and our <i>h&rsquo;s</i>. Our servants having learned our
English, it became necessary for us to drop our <i>g&rsquo;s</i>;
we seem at present unwilling in the matter of the <i>h</i>,
but that will come.</p>

<p>To cut the cackle and come to the clothes-horse,
let me say that the bunglement of clothes which
passes all comprehension in King George IV.&rsquo;s
reign is best explained by my cuttings from the
book of one who apparently knew. Let the older
writer have his, or her, fling in his, or her, words.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">&lsquo;CUROSY REMARKS ON THE LAST NEW
FASHIONS.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The City of London is now, indeed, most
splendid in its buildings and extent; London is
carried into the country; but never was it more
deserted.</p>

<p>&lsquo;A very, very few years ago, and during the
summer, the dresses of the wives and daughters of
our opulent tradesmen would furnish subjects for
the investigators of fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>443]</a></span>
&lsquo;Now, if those who chance to remain in London
take a day&rsquo;s excursion of about eight or ten miles
distance from the Metropolis, they hear the innkeepers
deprecating the steamboats, by which they
declare they are almost ruined: on Sundays, which
would sometimes bring them the clear profits of
ten or twenty pounds, they now scarce produce ten
shillings.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No; those of the middle class belonging to
<i>Cockney Island</i> must leave town, though the days
are short, and even getting cold and comfortless; the
steamboats carrying them off by shoals to Margate
and its vicinity.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The pursuit after elegant and superior modes of
dress must carry us farther; it is now from the
rural retirement of the country seats belonging to
the noble and wealthy that we must collect them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Young ladies wear their hair well arranged, but
not quite with the simplicity that prevailed last
month; during the warmth of the summer months,
the braids across the forehead were certainly the
best; but now, when neither in fear of heat or
damp, the curls again appear in numerous clusters
round the face; and some young ladies, who seem
to place their chief pride in a fine head of hair,
have such a multitude of small ringlets that give to
what is a natural charm all the <em>poodle-like</em> appearance
of a wig.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>444]</a></span>
&lsquo;The bows of hair are elevated on the summit of
the head, and confined by a comb of tortoise-shell.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Caps of the cornette kind are much in fashion,
made of blond, and ornamented with flowers, or
puffs of coloured gauze; most of the cornettes are
small, and tie under the chin, with a bow on one
side, of white satin ribbon; those which have
ribbons or gauze lappets floating loose have them
much shorter than formerly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;A few dress hats have been seen at dinner-parties
and musical amateur meetings in the country,
of transparent white crape, ornamented with a small
elegant bouquet of marabones.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When these dress hats are of coloured crape,
they are generally ornamented with flowers of the
same tint as the hat, in preference to feathers.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Printed muslins and chintzes are still very
much worn in the morning walks, with handsome
sashes, having three ends depending down each
side, not much beyond the hips. With one of
these dresses we saw a young lady wear a rich black
satin pelerine, handsomely trimmed with a very
beautiful black blond; it had a very neat effect, as
the dress was light.</p>

<p>&lsquo;White muslin dresses, though they are always
worn partially in the country till the winter actually
commences, are now seldom seen except on the
young: the embroidery on these dresses is exquisite.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>445]</a></span>
Dresses of Indian red, either in taffety or chintz,
have already made their appearance, and are expected
to be much in favour the ensuing winter;
the chintzes have much black in their patterns; but
this light material will, in course, be soon laid aside
for silks, and these, like the taffeties which have
partially appeared, will no doubt be plain: with
these dresses was worn a Canezon spencer, with
long sleeves of white muslin, trimmed with narrow
lace.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Gros de Naples dresses are very general, especially
for receiving dinner-parties, and for friendly
evening society.</p>

<p>&lsquo;At private dances, the only kind of ball that has
at present taken place, are worn dresses of the
white-figured gauze over white satin or gros de
Naples; at the theatricals sometimes performed by
noble amateurs, the younger part of the audience,
who do not take a part, are generally attired in
very clear muslin, over white satin, with drapery
scarves of lace, bar&ecirc;ge, or thick embroidered tulle.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Cachemire shawls, with a white ground, and a
pattern of coloured flowers or green foliage, are
now much worn in outdoor costumes, especially
for the morning walk; the mornings being rather
chilly, these warm envelopes are almost indispensable.
We are sorry, however, to find our modern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>446]</a></span>
belles so tardy in adopting those coverings, which
ought now to succeed to the light appendages of
summer costume.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The muslin Canezon spencer, the silk fichu,
and even the lighter bar&ecirc;ge, are frequently the
sole additions to a high dress, or even to one but
partially so.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We have lately seen finished to the order of a
lady of rank in the county of Suffolk, a very
beautiful pelisse of jonquil-coloured gros de Naples.
It fastens close down from the throat to the feet,
in front, with large covered buttons; at a suitable
distance on each side of this fastening are three
bias folds, rather narrow, brought close together
under the belt, and enlarging as they descend to
the border of the skirt. A large pelerine cape is
made to take on and off; and the bust from the
back of each shoulder is ornamented with the same
bias folds, forming a stomacher in front of the
waist. The sleeves, <i>&agrave; la Marie</i>, are puckered a few
inches above the wrist, and confined by three straps;
each with a large button. Though long ends are
very much in favour with silk pelerines, yet there
are quite as many that are quite round; such was
the black satin pelerine we cited above.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Coloured bonnets are now all the rage; we are
happy to say that some, though all too large, are in
the charming cottage style, and are modestly tied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>447]</a></span>
under the chin. Some bonnets are so excessively
large that they are obliged to be placed quite at
the back of the head; and as their extensive brims
will not support a veil, when they are ornamented
with a broad blond, the edge of that just falls over
the hair, but does not even conceal the eyes.
Leghorn hats are very general; their trimmings
consist chiefly of ribbons, though some ladies add
a few branches of green foliage between the bows
or puffs: these are chiefly of the fern; a great
improvement to these green branches is the having
a few wild roses intermingled.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The most admired colours are lavender, Esterhazy,
olive-green, lilac, marshmallow blossom, and
Indian red.</p>

<p>&lsquo;At rural f&ecirc;tes, the ornaments of the hats generally
consist of flowers; these hats are backward in
the Arcadian fashion, and discover a wreath of
small flowers on the hair, <i>ex bandeau</i>. In Paris the
most admired colours are ethereal-blue, Hortensia,
cameleopard-yellow, pink, grass-green, jonquil, and
Parma-violet.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>September 1, 1827.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Really this little fashion book is very charming:
it recreates, for me, the elegant simpering ladies; it
gives, in its style, just that artificial note which
conjures this age of ladies with hats&mdash;&lsquo;in the charming
cottage style, modestly tied under the chin.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>448]</a></span>
They had the complete art of languor, these dear
creatures; they lisped Italian, and were fine needlewomen;
they painted weak little landscapes: nooks
or arbours found them dreaming of a Gothic revival&mdash;they
were all this and more; but through this sweet
envelope the delicate refined souls shone: they were
true women, often great women; their loops of
hair, their cameleopard pelerines, shall not rob them
of immortality, cannot destroy their softening
influence, which permeated even the outrageous
dandyism of the men of their time and steered the
three-bottle gentlemen, their husbands and our
grandfathers, into a grand old age which we reverence
to-day, and wonder at, seeing them as giants
against our nerve-shattered, drug-taking generation.</p>

<p>As for the men, look at the innumerable pictures,
and collect, for instance, the material for a colossal
work upon the stock ties of the time, run your list
of varieties into some semblance of order; commence
with the varieties of macassar-brown stocks, pass
on to patent leather stocks, take your man for a
walk and cause him to pass a window full of
Hibernian stocks, and let him discourse on the
stocks worn by turf enthusiasts, and, when you are
approaching the end of your twenty-third volume,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>449]</a></span>
give a picture of a country dinner-party, and end
your work with a description of the gentlemen
under the table being relieved of their stocks by
the faithful family butler.</p>


<h3>POWDER AND PATCHES</h3>

<p class="center">&lsquo;The affectation of a mole, to set off their beauty,
such as Venus had.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="center">&lsquo;At the devill&rsquo;s shopps you buy<br />
A dresse of powdered hayre.&rsquo;</p>


<p>From the splendid pageant of history what figures
come to you most willingly? Does a great procession
go by the window of your mind? Knights
bronzed by the sun of Palestine, kings in chains,
emperors in blood-drenched purple, poets clothed
like grocers with the souls of angels shining
through their eyes, fussy Secretaries of State, informers,
spies, inquisitors, Court cards come to life,
harlequins, statesmen in great ruffs, wives of Bath
in foot-mantles and white wimples, sulky Puritans,
laughing Cavaliers, Dutchmen drinking gin and
talking politics, men in wide-skirted coats and
huge black periwigs&mdash;all walking, riding, being
carried in coaches, in sedan-chairs, over the face of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>450]</a></span>
England. Every step of the procession yields
wonderful dreams of colour; in every group there
is one who, by the personality of his clothes, can
claim the name of beau.</p>

<p>Near the tail of the throng there is a chattering,
bowing, rustling crowd, dimmed by a white mist
of scented hair-powder. They are headed, I think&mdash;for
one cannot see too clearly&mdash;by the cook of
the Comte de Bellemare, a man by name Legros,
the great hairdresser. Under his arm is a book,
the title of which reads, &lsquo;Art de la Coiffure des
Dames Fran&ccedil;aises.&rsquo; Behind him is a lady in an
enormous hoop; her hair is dressed <i>&agrave; la belle Poule</i>;
she is arguing some minute point of the disposition
of patches with Monsieur L&eacute;onard, another artist
in hair. &lsquo;What will be the next wear?&rsquo; she asks.
&lsquo;A heart near the eye&mdash;<i>l&rsquo;assassine</i>, eh? Or a star
near the lips&mdash;<i>la friponne</i>? Must I wear a <i>galante</i>
on my cheek, an <i>enjou&eacute;e</i> in my dimple, or <i>la
majestueuse</i> on my forehead?&rsquo; Before we can hear
the reply another voice is raised, a guttural German
voice; it is John Schnorr, the ironmaster of Erzgebinge.
&lsquo;The feet stuck in it, I tell you,&rsquo; he says&mdash;&lsquo;actually
stuck! I got from my saddle and looked
at the ground. My horse had carried me on to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>451]</a></span>
what proved to be a mine of wealth. Hair-powder!
I sold it in Dresden, in Leipsic; and then, at
Meissen, what does B&ouml;ttcher do but use my hair-powder
to make white porcelain!&rsquo; And so the
chatter goes on. Here is Charles Fox tapping the
ground with his red heels and proclaiming, in a
voice thick with wine, on the merits of blue hair-powder;
here is Brummell, free from hair-powder,
free from the obnoxious necessity of going with his
regiment to Manchester.</p>

<p>The dressy person and the person who is well
dressed&mdash;these two showing everywhere. The one is
in a screaming hue of woad, the other a quiet note
of blue dye; the one in excessive velvet sleeves that
he cannot manage, the other controlling a rich
amplitude of material with perfect grace. Here a
liripipe is extravagantly long; here a gold circlet
decorates curled locks with matchless taste. Everywhere
the battle between taste and gaudiness.
High hennins, steeples of millinery, stick up out
of the crowd; below these, the towers of powdered
hair bow and sway as the fine ladies patter along.
What a rustle and a bustle of silks and satins,
of flowered tabbies, rich brocades, cut velvets,
superfine cloths, woollens, cloth of gold!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>452]</a></span>
See, there are the square-shouldered Tudors;
there are the steel glints of Plantagenet armour;
the Eastern-robed followers of C&oelig;ur de Lion; the
swaggering beribboned Royalists; the ruffs, trunks,
and doublets of Elizabethans; the snuffy, wide-skirted
coats swaying about Queen Anne. There
are the soft, swathed Norman ladies with bound-up
chins; the tapestry figures of ladies proclaiming
Agincourt; the dignified dames about Elizabeth of
York; the playmates of Katherine Howard; the
wheels of round farthingales and the high lace collars
of King James&rsquo;s Court; the beauties, bare-breasted,
of Lely; the Hogarthian women in close caps.
And, in front of us, two posturing figures in
Dresden china colours, rouged, patched, powdered,
perfumed, in hoop skirts, flirting with a fan&mdash;the
lady; in gold-laced wide coat, solitaire, bagwig,
ruffles, and red heels&mdash;the gentleman. &lsquo;I protest,
madam,&rsquo; he is saying, &lsquo;but you flatter me vastly.&rsquo;
&lsquo;La, sir,&rsquo; she replies, &lsquo;I am prodigiously truthful.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And how are we to know that all this is true?&rsquo;
the critics ask, guarding the interest of the public.
&lsquo;We see that your book is full of statements, and
there are no, or few, authorities given for your
studies. Where,&rsquo; they ask, &lsquo;are the venerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>453]</a></span>
anecdotes which are given a place in every respectable
work on your subject?&rsquo;</p>

hungry for skeletons, I give a short list of those

other books, prints, engravings, sets of pictures,
and heaps of caricatures. The excellent labours of
the Society of Antiquaries and the Arch&aelig;ological
Association have helped me enormously; these,
with wills, wardrobe accounts, &lsquo;Satires&rsquo; by Hall
and others, &lsquo;Anatomies of Abuses,&rsquo; broadsides, and
other works on the same subject, French, German,
and English, have made my task easier than it
might have been.</p>

<p>It was no use to spin out my list of manuscripts
with the numbers&mdash;endless numbers&mdash;of those which
proved dry ground, so I have given those only
which have yielded a rich harvest.</p>


<h3>BEAU BRUMMELL AND CLOTHES</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>&lsquo;A person, my dear, who will probably come and
speak to us; and if he enters into conversation, be
careful to give him a favourable impression of you,
for,&rsquo; and she sunk her voice to a whisper, &lsquo;he is the
celebrated Mr. Brummell.&rsquo;</i>&mdash;&lsquo;Life of Beau Brummell,&rsquo;
Captain Jesse.</p>
</div>

<p>Those who care to make the melancholy pilgrimage
may see, in the Protestant Cemetery at Caen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>456]</a></span>
the tomb of George Bryan Brummell. He died, at
the age of sixty-two, in 1840.</p>

<p>It is indeed a melancholy pilgrimage to view the
tomb of that once resplendent figure, to think,
before the hideous grave, of the witty, clever,
foolish procession from Eton to Oriel College,
Oxford; from thence to a captaincy in the 10th
Hussars, from No. 4 Chesterfield Street to No. 13
Chapel Street, Park Lane; from Chapel Street a
flight to Calais; from Calais to Paris; and then, at
last, to Caen, and the bitter, bitter end, mumbling
and mad, to die in the Bon Sauveur.</p>

<p>Place him beside the man who once pretended
to be his friend, the man of whom Thackeray spoke
so truly: &lsquo;But a bow and a grin. I try and take
him to pieces, and find silk stockings, padding,
stays, a coat with frogs and a fur coat, a star and a
blue ribbon, a pocket handkerchief prodigiously
scented, one of Truefitt&rsquo;s best nutty-brown wigs
reeking with oil, a set of teeth, and a huge black
stock, under-waistcoats, more under-waistcoats, and
then nothing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Nothing! Thackeray is right; absolutely nothing
remains of this King George of ours but a sale list
of his wardrobe, a wardrobe which fetched &pound;15,000
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>457]</a></span>
second-hand&mdash;a wardrobe that had been a man.
He invented a shoe-buckle 1 inch long and
5 inches broad. He wore a pink silk coat with
white cuffs. He had 5,000 steel beads on his hat.
He was a coward, a good-natured, contemptible
voluptuary. Beside him, in our eyes, walks for a
time the elegant figure of Beau Brummell. I
have said that Brummell was the inventor of
modern dress: it is true. He was the Beau who
raised the level of dress from the slovenly, dirty
linen, the greasy hair, the filthy neckcloth, the
crumbled collar, to a position, ever since held
by Englishmen, of quiet, unobtrusive cleanliness,
decent linen, an abhorrence of striking forms of
dress.</p>

<p>He made clean linen and washing daily a part
of English life.</p>

<p>See him seated before his dressing-glass, a
mahogany-framed sliding cheval glass with brass
arms on either sides for candles. By his side is
George IV., recovering from his drunken bout of
last night. The Beau&rsquo;s glass reflects his clean-complexioned
face, his grey eyes, his light brown hair,
and sandy whiskers. A servant produces a shirt
with a 12-inch collar fixed to it, assists the Beau
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>458]</a></span>
into it, arranges it, and stands aside. The collar
nearly hides the Beau&rsquo;s face. Now, with his hand
protected with a discarded shirt, he folds his collar
down to the required height. Now he takes his
white stock and folds it carefully round the collar;
the stock is a foot high and slightly starched.
A supreme moment of artistic decision, and the
stock and collar take their perfect creases. In an
hour or so he will be ready to partake of a light
meal with the royal gentleman. He will stand up
and survey himself in his morning dress, his regular,
quiet suit. A blue coat, light breeches fitting the
leg well, a light waistcoat over a waistcoat of some
other colour, never a startling contrast, Hessian
boots, or top-boots and buckskins. There was
nothing very peculiar about his clothes except, as
Lord Byron said, &lsquo;an exquisite propriety.&rsquo; His
evening dress was a blue coat, white waistcoat,
black trousers buttoned at the ankle&mdash;these were
of his own invention, and one may say it was the
wearing of them that made trousers more popular
than knee-breeches&mdash;striped silk stockings, and a
white stock.</p>

<p>He was a man of perfect taste&mdash;of fastidious
taste. On his tables lay books of all kinds in fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>459]</a></span>
covers. Who would suspect it? but the Prince is
leaning an arm on a copy of Ellis&rsquo;s &lsquo;Early English
Metrical Romances.&rsquo; The Beau is a rhymer, an
elegant verse-maker. Here we see the paper-presser
of Napoleon&mdash;I am flitting for the moment
over some years, and see him in his room in Calais&mdash;here
we notice his passion for buhl, his S&egrave;vres
china painted with Court beauties.</p>

<p>In his house in Chapel Street he saw daily portraits
of Nelson and Pitt and George III. upon his
walls. This is no Beau as we understand the term,
for we make it a word of contempt, a nickname for
a feeble fellow in magnificent garments. Rather
this is the room of an educated gentleman of
&lsquo;exquisite propriety.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He played high, as did most gentlemen; he was
superstitious, as are many of the best of men.
That lucky sixpence with the hole in it that
you gave to a cabman, Beau Brummell, was
that loss the commencement of your downward
career?</p>

<p>There are hundreds of anecdotes of Brummell
which, despite those of the &lsquo;George, ring the bell&rsquo;
character, and those told of his heavy gaming, are
more valuable as showing his wit, his cleanliness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>460]</a></span>
his distaste of display&mdash;in fact, his &lsquo;exquisite propriety.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A Beau is hardly a possible figure to-day; we
have so few personalities, and those we have are
chiefly concerned with trade&mdash;men who uphold
trusts, men who fight trusts, men who speak for
trade in the House of Commons. We have not
the same large vulgarities as our grandfathers, nor
have we the same wholesome refinement; in killing
the evil&mdash;the great gambler, the great men of
the turf, the great prize-fighters, the heavy wine-drinkers&mdash;we
have killed, also, the good, the classic,
well-spoken civil gentleman. Our manners have
suffered at the expense of our morals.</p>

<p>Fifty or sixty years ago the world was full
of great men, saying, writing, thinking, great
things. To-day&mdash;perhaps it is too early to speak
of to-day. Personalities are so little marked by
their clothes, by any stamp of individuality, that
the caricaturist, or even the minute and truthful
artist, be he painter or writer, has a difficult task
before him when he sets out to point at the men of
these our times.</p>

<p>George Brummell came into the world on June 7,
1778. He was a year or so late for the Macaroni
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>461]</a></span>
style of dress, many years behind the Fribbles, after
the Smarts, and must have seen the rise and fall of
the Zebras when he was thirteen. During his life
he saw the old-fashioned full frock-coat, bagwig,
solitaire, and ruffles die away; he saw the decline
and fall of knee-breeches for common wear, and
the pantaloons invented by himself take their place.
From these pantaloons reaching to the ankle came
the trousers, as fashionable garments, open over the
instep at first, and joined by loops and buttons, then
strapped under the boot, and after that in every
manner of cut to the present style. He saw the
three-cornered hat vanish from the hat-boxes of the
polite world, and he saw fine-coloured clothes give
way to blue coats with brass buttons or coats of
solemn black.</p>

<p>It may be said that England went into mourning
over the French Revolution, and has not yet
recovered. Beau Brummell, on his way to Eton,
saw a gay-coloured crowd of powdered and patched
people, saw claret-coloured coats covered with
embroidery, gold-laced hats, twinkling shoe-buckles.
On his last walks in Caen, no doubt, he dreamed
of London as a place of gay colours instead of the
drab place it was beginning to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>462]</a></span>
To-day there is no more monotonous sight than
the pavements of Piccadilly crowded with people
in dingy, sad clothes, with silk tubes on their heads,
their black and gray suits being splashed by the
mud from black hansoms, or by the scatterings of
motor-cars driven by aristocratic-looking mechanics,
in which mechanical-looking aristocrats lounge,
darkly clad. Here and there some woman&rsquo;s dress
enlivens the monotony; here a red pillar-box shines
in the sun; there, again, we bless the Post-Office
for their red mail-carts, and perhaps we are
strengthened to bear the gloom by the sight of a
blue or red bus.</p>

<p>But our hearts are not in tune with the picture;
we feel the lack of colour, of romance, of everything
but money, in the street. Suddenly a magnificent
policeman stops the traffic; there is a sound of
jingling harness, of horses&rsquo; hoofs beating in unison.
There flashes upon us an escort of Life Guards
sparkling in the sun, flashing specks of light from
swords, breastplates, helmets. The little forest of
waving plumes, the raising of hats, the polite murmuring
of cheers, warms us. We feel young, our
hearts beat; we feel more healthy, more alive, for
this gleam of colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>463]</a></span>
Then an open carriage passes us swiftly as we
stand with bared heads. There is a momentary sight
of a man in uniform&mdash;a man with a wonderful face,
clever, dignified, kind. And we say, with a catch
in our voices:</p>

<p class="center smcap">&lsquo;The King&mdash;God bless him!&rsquo;</p>
